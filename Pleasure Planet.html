In only a few days, I&#39;ll be off!

At last, I&#39;m going to be on my way back to &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Starfleet|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;starfleet&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Academy.|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;academy&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; This year I&#39;m not taking a shuttle with my family, but that&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not a freshman cadet any more. I don&#39;t need a send-off celebration or anything this time around -- man, that was embarrassing. No, this year I&#39;m going to book a double berth on a civilian passenger ship, the //Beta Centauri//. I&#39;ll be traveling with a cadet I met last year, Pyria Calinor. She&#39;s a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Bajoran,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;bajoran&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; but she&#39;ll a pretty good roommate, I&#39;m sure. After all, the trip will only last for a few days, and nobody in their right mind attacks a ship with a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Klingon|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;klingon&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; captain, even if it&#39;s a passenger vessel.

I feel like I&#39;ve grown up a lot in the last year, too. It must be all these new responsibilities. They really did push duty on us during our first year, when we&#39;re all doing our basics: interplanetary law, ethics, leadership, all the team and solo athletics. Am I sure glad that&#39;s all over with -- and all that math and chemistry, too! This year we should get into more interesting areas of study.

__ Personal log, stardate 48442.6 __
I have procrastinated long enough on filling out my Academy application form. It&#39;s pretty hard to decide what kind of classes to register for. They all sound interesting, but at the same time, they all sound really hard. Isn&#39;t that weird? Every since I can remember, I wanted to be in Starfleet. Now that I&#39;m here, it&#39;s a lot harder to decide what I really want out of it.

I could go into [[command|Start3][$dept to &quot;command&quot;, $deptnum to 0,  $inv.push(&quot;tricorder&quot;), $deptmusclemod to 2]], but it sounds like there are a lot more classes in law and diplomacy. [[Security|Start3][$dept to &quot;security&quot;, $deptnum to 1, $inv.push(&quot;tricorder&quot;), $deptmusclemod to 4]] sounds like it gets a lot of action, which is good and bad, I guess.

The [[engineering|Start3][$dept to &quot;engineering&quot;, $deptnum to 3, $inv.push(&quot;tricorder&quot;), $inv.push(&quot;toolbox&quot;), $deptmusclemod to 1]] department could always use more good technicians, but I have to specialize in something, and most of those specialties sound really hard: lots of advanced physics, lots of math. They say lots of candidates wash out of that program. I could always apply for the [[operations|Start3][$dept to &quot;operations&quot;, $deptnum to 2, $inv.push(&quot;tricorder&quot;), $deptmusclemod to 1]] department, maybe be a shuttle pilot or a transporter chief or a communications officer or something, but recruiters say that&#39;s what everybody does, and it&#39;s hard to get good placements with a specialization like that.

I&#39;d feel a lot better about choosing [[science|Start3][$dept = &quot;science&quot;, $deptnum to 5, $inv.push(&quot;tricorder&quot;)]] or medicine if I&#39;d got a better final grade in Multivariable Calculus. It&#39;s those &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Vulcans,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;vulcan&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; messing up the grading curve for everybody else. I wouldn&#39;t mind going into the sciences and doing botany or xenolinguistics. Then again, if I went into [[medicine|Start3][$dept to &quot;medicine&quot;, $deptnum to 4, $inv.push(&quot;medical tricorder&quot;), $deptmusclemod to 1]], I&#39;d have a career lined up outside of Starfleet when I was done with my tour of duty.

Damn, I have to fill out that form.

I guess I&#39;d better start getting used to early mornings again. It was such an early departure. Only my father was there to see me off. That&#39;s not surprising. Nobody in their right mind gets up at this hour.

I ran into Pyria Calinor again as we were waiting in the lounge for the //Beta Centauri// to depart. Looks like this won&#39;t be such a bad trip. I almost called her &quot;Cadet Calinor,&quot; then I remembered our Federation Cultures seminar on &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Bajoran|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;bajoran&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; family names. I corrected myself and called her &quot;Cadet Pyria&quot; instead. I don&#39;t think she noticed, which is good. The last thing I need on this trip is getting into constant little arguments with a fiery Bajoran bunkmate. That won&#39;t happen anyway, I guess, because most of the time she won&#39;t even be in our cabin. She&#39;s pulling guard duty on board the ship: some political prisoner or other is being transported, and she volunteered to stand a few watches outside his cabin. &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;security&quot;&gt;&gt;I should have thought of that, damn it. It would have been &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It&#39;s &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;a good way to earn extra credit hours.

I packed all my gear into the cabin I&#39;m sharing with Pyria on the trip back. She&#39;s already claimed a bunk. I can see her travel case next to a bed on the port side of the cabin. It&#39;s small, but she&#39;s ex-Bajoran military, so she packs light.

My case is huge. I don&#39;t know how much of [[my gear|Start3.3]] I&#39;m going to need on the flight. Maybe I should just [[check out the ship|Start 3.4]].

&lt;span class=&quot;pic&quot; padding=1em&gt;[&lt;img[allaire.png]]&lt;/span&gt;I ran into another cadet, Zoya Allaire. She&#39;s this beautiful girl of Russian and French descent, and I don&#39;t really know her all that well.  She started out in medicine her freshman year. She &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;medicine&quot;&gt;&gt;was a teacher&#39;s aide in my Field First Aid class, but that&#39;s about all I know about her.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;was a teacher&#39;s aide in one of my classes, according to her anyway -- she remembers me better than I remember her.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; She&#39;s doing some volunteer work in the infirmary. Just assisting the ship&#39;s physician, she says; she&#39;s only licensed as a junior nurse. Anyway, it was good to get to know her a little better.

Of course, she asked whether I was dating anyone, and it got a little awkward. I never know what to tell people.

We didn&#39;t get a chance to talk much. An &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Orion|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;orion&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; diplomat came into the infirmary right after I arrived. The people you meet on an ordinary starship! Isn&#39;t that incredible? This uniform is really going to take me places.

Anyway, Zoya kicked me out of the infirmary for a while so the diplomat could have some privacy. I&#39;m recording this log outside the infirmary door. That&#39;s what I get for having a dad who was a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[transporter|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;transporter&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; chief. He always says to me, &quot;$playerfirst, document //everything!//&quot; So here I am.

After Zoya let me back into the infirmary, we talked some more, so I just have to record a more things before I forget about them. 

I asked about the diplomat, but she said it was nothing: he had been looking for the regular ship&#39;s doctor, but it was just her holding the fort while he was out. She took down his information and said the doctor would get back to him. She&#39;s just a junior nurse, after all.

&quot;It makes me feel terrible,&quot; Cadet Allaire said, obviously downcast. &quot;There&#39;s just nothing I can do for him. I feel so useless!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; I asked. &quot;Was it that &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;medicine&quot;&gt;&gt;patient just now?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;guy just now?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I can&#39;t tell you anything about it,&quot; Cadet Allaire said carefully. &quot;I&#39;ve never learned about it in my Academy studies, so even if it weren&#39;t confidential, I wouldn&#39;t know how to explain it to you. But it&#39;s progressive, and it&#39;s incurable. There&#39;s not a thing I can do. There&#39;s nothing //anybody// can do.&quot;

Also, I&#39;d better make a note of this too, in case it comes up again. I remember telling Zoya that I &lt;&lt;if $reply == &quot;boyfriend&quot;&gt;&gt;had a boyfriend.&lt;&lt;elseif $reply == &quot;girlfriend&quot;&gt;&gt;had a girlfriend.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;was dating a few people.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Was it serious? she asked. When I mentioned that &lt;&lt;if $orient == &quot;gay male&quot; or $orient == &quot;straight female&quot;&gt;&gt;my boyfriend and I shared a dorm at the Academy,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my girlfriend and I shared a dorm room at the Academy,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; right away she dropped the subject. I wonder if she had been flirting with me.

I just ran into Admiral Tamura. Apparently she&#39;s on her way back to the Academy for the start of term as well.

We talked a little about my sophomore year registration. &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;command&quot;&gt;&gt;When I said I was going into command, she asked, &quot;Going for the captain&#39;s chair, are you? Good. We need more skilled captains badly -- ensigns maybe even more. The Federation has been rebuilding quickly since the Borg a few years ago. We&#39;ve got so many ships coming out of the Titan yards, fresh ensigns are being snapped up right out of the Academy.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $dept == &quot;security&quot;&gt;&gt;She seemed happy I was going into security. She told me, &quot;The Federation has been rebuilding over the last decade, ever since the &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Borg,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;borg&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; and we&#39;re going to need to keep a lid on the periphery.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Even when there&#39;s more than enough for every colonist, some people still insist on stealing and hoarding.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $dept == &quot;engineering&quot;&gt;&gt;I mentioned that I was registering with the engineering department, and she laughed. &quot;A wrench bender, eh? I hope you&#39;re better at Metallurgy than I was. Or did they replace that course with Replicated Metallics? About all I learned from that course was how to accidentally burn a hole in our blast shielding.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $dept == &quot;operations&quot;&gt;&gt;When I said I was going into operations, she nodded. &quot;It&#39;s a competitive field ot there for ops, but ships run on good ops personnel, and there&#39;s always plenty of room for more. If you&#39;re able to stand out from the crowd, you&#39;ll do all right.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $dept == &quot;science&quot;&gt;&gt;I mentioned I was pursuing science, and she said to me, &quot;That&#39;s outstanding. I have an older brother who went into Astrophysics. He&#39;s stationed out near Groombridge 34. I always wondered where my career might have gone if I had followed him into the sciences.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $dept == &quot;medicine&quot;&gt;&gt;When I told her my plans to go into medicine, she said, &quot;Skilled physicians are in high demand right now. A lot of Starfleet veterans have come back from the fronts at Eyeclock, and they need the best care we can give them.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

I told her I was surprised to see her on a civilian transport ship, but she said it was a waste of fleet resources to use a starship as a taxi service.

Admiral Tamura laughed. &quot;Not the glorious luxury cruise you imagine an admiral deserves? Well, I was coming back from Kyther, and there weren&#39;t any Federation ships that suited my schedule. The Fleet offered to send a cruiser, but that just costs time and money -- and I //know// the crew would grumble about having to chaperone a flag officer.&quot;

She gave me a few suggestions about ...

Not sure if I have time for a long entry. Ship is under attack. Our Klingon captain came on the intercom to let us know there were several unidentified vessels.

His message was: &quot;Attention. We are being engaged by an unknown vessel. All passengers and nonessential personnel please return to your cabins at this time. Obey the commands of the senior crew until further notice. If we are boarded, stay out of the hallways unless you like being shot.&quot; As an afterthought, he added with a snarl, &quot;We hope you are ... enjoying your flight.&quot;

I found Erelan and Darvok in their cabin, and asked if they heard the Admiral&#39;s orders.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Darvok said, without a trace of reaction. &quot;Boarders inbound.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s give them a warm welcome,&quot; Ereland suggested.

&lt;&lt;set $comm to 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;Drugh Intercom&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Planet?&quot; I asked. &quot;What planet could that be? There aren&#39;t many habitable worlds in this sector, are there?&quot;

Darvok consulted his data pad. &quot;I do not have our current location. Based on our flight path, typical cruising speed for a vessel of this class, and the current time, I estimate the world in question is likely to be &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Procrustes,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;procrustes&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; an uninhabited class M planet once home to a large and complex alien civilization. Its status in the archives is listed as Contact Prohibited. Other information on the world is classified.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps that&#39;s where the pirates were coming from,&quot; Erelan suggested. &quot;A place where nobody goes is a perfect place for a pirate hideout.&quot;

&quot;Possible,&quot; Darvok admitted. &quot;Provided the world is safe.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s class M,&quot; I objected.

&quot;That does not guarantee a safe harbor,&quot; the Vulcan pointed out. &quot;Only a compatible gravity, a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, and available water.&quot;

&quot;Well, buckle up, big guy,&quot; Erelan said. &quot;Apparently we&#39;re going there.&quot;

&quot;If we do not intervene, then that course seems certain,&quot; Darvok replied.

It was hard to know what to do. I might be able to [[think of a plan|BC: Make Plans][$award to 1]], but perhaps I should [[let the others|BC: Listen to Others]] figure things out first.

I bumped into a couple more cadets, Darvok the &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Vulcan|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;vulcan&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; and Erelan the &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Orion.|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;orion&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; They&#39;re bunking together for the trip back, if you can imagine it: logical, stolid Darvok with his stellar grades and his poker face, and Erelan, the big handsome green guy with all the muscles and girlfriends all over campus. Darvok is going into the &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[science|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;science&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; department, specializing in astrophysics, to the surprise of absolutely nobody. Erelan is going into &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[operations.|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;operations&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; Communications, by the way he&#39;s always talking. With those muscles, I&#39;d have guessed &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[security,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;security&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; but apparently Erelan isn&#39;t actually all that strong for an Orion, so it didn&#39;t really occur to him. Besides, he likes helping others, especially if those others have cute eyes and nice legs.

Their cabin was fairly near to Calinor&#39;s and mine. When I went to visit them, Darvok was studying and Erelan was lying on his bunk with his feet up.

&quot;Hello, $playerfirst,&quot; Erelan murmured without opening his eyes.  &quot;Please don&#39;t take offense if I don&#39;t rise.&quot;

&quot;Did you have a long night?&quot; I asked. &quot;And if so, with whom?&quot;

&quot;A long night, no. A long afternoon, yes,&quot; he said. &quot;However, I won&#39;t tell you their names, except that one was Klingon, and one was Bajoran, and they were both luscious.&quot;

&quot;I have rarely heard a Klingon female described,&quot; says Cadet Darvok, looking up from his data pad, &quot;as &#39;luscious.&#39;&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t met any good ones, then. Please excuse me, $playerfirst. I&#39;m trying to get back onto Earth time. My body still thinks it&#39;s four in the morning.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; I said, waving at him. &quot;How&#39;s it going with you, Darvok?&quot;

&quot;It,&quot; he repeated, puzzled. &quot;If by //it// you mean this transport ship, I am unaware of its current velocity.&quot;

&quot;It,&quot; I said with a smile. &quot;You. The Academy. Life. Your studies. Everything.&quot;

&quot;Ah. It, the extrapositional clause-controlling pronoun,&quot; Darvok said, taking a moment to adjust his Vulcan thinking. &quot;My studies proceed. I am preparing for my upcoming class in Advanced Flux Mechanics.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re already studying for the next quarter?&quot; I asked.

&quot;I began as soon as my registration was confirmed,&quot; Darvok noted fastidiously. &quot;My parents were disappointed that my performance median is in danger of slipping below 105%.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all that extra credit,&quot; yawned Cadet Erelan from his bunk.

&quot;What are you studying?&quot; I asked Darvok.

&quot;At the present I am endeavoring to commit the trinomial distribution tables to memory.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; I said, testing his response to Earth sarcasm.  &quot;Sounds riveting.&quot;

&quot;Actually, it is not,&quot; the Vulcan corrected me, oblivious to irony.  &quot;My parents would have preferred that I perform the trinomial calculations in my head, but I am afraid my calculation skills are still inadequate for the task. Memorization will serve as well for the purposes of a rough estimate.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, of course,&quot; I said, even though I wouldn&#39;t know a trinomial table if it stole my data pad.

&quot;So as you must appreciate,&quot; Darvok continued, &quot;I have to return to my studies.  Please excuse me.&quot;

I left them in their room. I should probably find them later and see what they&#39;re doing. [[Out for now|Start4]].

__Notes__
&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Muscle&lt;/span&gt;
* Muscle is rated from 1 to 20 and up, with females averaging about 3 fewer points of muscle than males.
* Your muscle score includes a bonus of $deptmusclemod because your specialty is $dept.
* Typical muscle rating for various species:
** Bajoran male (4-16, average 10.0)
** Betazoid male (4-16, average 10.0)
** Bolian male (4-16, average 10.0) 
** Cardassian male (7-19, average 13.0)
** Ferengi male (4-13, average 8.5)
** Human male (4-16, average 10.0)
** Klingon male (10-19, average 14.5)
** Orion male (7-22, average 14.5)
** Romulan male (4-19, average 11.5)
** Trill male (7-19, average 13.0)
** Vulcan male (4-19, average 11.5)

&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Fighting Prowess&lt;/span&gt;
* Fighting prowess is a calculation based on your height, muscle, and brawling ability. Because males generally have an advantage of both, they are usually better at physical combat (but not always). Brawling ability counts directly as muscle, so a female can use superior skill to defeat an untrained male.
* Typical fighting prowess for various species (female/male):
** Bajoran: 24/30
** Betazoid: 24/30
** Bolian: 24/30
** Cardassian: 28/34
** Ferengi: 21/27
** Human: 24/30
** Klingon: 31/37
** Orion: 31/37
** Romulan: 26/32
** Trill: 29/35

I ran back to my cabin to get my phaser and communicator badge. They were still where I had left them in my travel case.&lt;&lt;set $inv.push(&quot;communicator badge&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $inv.push(&quot;phaser&quot;)&gt;&gt; I tried calling for any other Starfleet cadets that might be listening, such as Erelan or Darvok, and listened for anything that sounded like fighting in the halls.

&lt;&lt;set $comm to 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;Drugh Intercom&quot;&gt;&gt;I hadn&#39;t been in my cabin very long when I heard Erelan&#39;s voice on the communicator. &quot;$playername, are you there?&quot;

I answered and said I was. Erelan said, &quot;Are you in your cabin? Be prepared to unlock your door. We&#39;re coming over.&quot;

When they arrived, they asked me if I had heard the news. Of course I had: we had a boarding party roaming on the //Beta Centauri//, and we were heading for some nearby planet. There weren&#39;t very many habitable worlds in this sector, so we tried to figure out where we were headed.

Darvok consulted his data pad. &quot;I do not have our current location. Based on our flight path, typical cruising speed for a vessel of this class, and the current time, I estimate the world in question is likely to be &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Procrustes,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;procrustes&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; an uninhabited class M planet once home to a large and complex alien civilization. Its status in the archives is listed as Contact Prohibited. Other information on the world is classified.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps that&#39;s where the pirates were coming from,&quot; Erelan suggested. &quot;A place where nobody goes is a perfect place for a pirate hideout.&quot;

&quot;Possible,&quot; Darvok admitted. &quot;Provided the world is safe.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s class M,&quot; I objected.

&quot;That does not guarantee a safe harbor,&quot; the Vulcan pointed out. &quot;Only a compatible gravity, a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, and available water.&quot;

&quot;Well, buckle up, big guy,&quot; Erelan said. &quot;Apparently we&#39;re going there.&quot;

&quot;If we do not intervene, then that course seems certain,&quot; Darvok replied.

It was hard to know what to do. I might be able to [[think of a plan|BC: Make Plans][$award to 1]], but perhaps I should [[let the others|BC: Listen to Others]] figure things out first.

&lt;span class=&quot;pic&quot; padding=1em&gt;[&lt;img[pyria.png]]&lt;/span&gt;As I was exploring the ship, I found where Pyria was pulling guard duty. It was just some ordinary cabin door, as far as I could tell, in some corridor amidships port. I took this picture of her to the left while she was standing guard, but she didn&#39;t look too amused at being bothered while she was on duty. She never is.

When I found her there, she just nodded at me professionally and said, &quot;$playername.&quot; Pyria Calinor hardly ever uses personal names. Must be a Bajoran thing.

I answered back in the same way: &quot;Hello, Cadet Pyria.&quot; Then I asked, &quot;Something big going on in there?&quot;

She smiled briefly. &quot;Big? He&#39;d better not be doing //anything// in there.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, he?&quot; I asked. &quot;Who&#39;s in there?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a prisoner transfer from &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Starbase|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;starbase&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; 904, on the periphery,&quot; she said with a touch of pride. &quot;Someone seeking asylum with the Federation, I think -- some kind of rabble-rouser back on &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Kyther|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;kyther&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; Prime. He&#39;s got a criminal record, but nothing major. We&#39;ll drop him off at Starbase 2 to be processed, but for now we have him confined to quarters.&quot;

&quot;He can&#39;t be dangerous,&quot; I guessed, &quot;if they have a cadet standing guard.&quot;

&quot;Probably not, I hope,&quot; she agreed, and then she gave me a nice brisk brush-off: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, $playername, I&#39;m on duty,&quot; and so forth. Still, it was more than I expected to get out of her.

The trip has been quiet so far. I&#39;ll record more [[tomorrow|Start3.5]].

__ Personal log, stardate 48445.5, addendum $add __
We just had a meeting, trying to decide what to do. I mostly listened to Darvok and Erelan as they argued about our current situation.

Erelan&#39;s position was that we needed to find any other potential allies we could. &quot;Right now, just the three of us, we&#39;re vulnerable,&quot; he said. &quot;We should search the ship and form a resistance team.&quot;

&quot;Our orders were to defend our deck,&quot; Darvok objected. &quot;We haven&#39;t the personnel to repel boarders on all decks.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why we look for allies,&quot; Erelan said immediately. &quot;Once we have a large enough force, we&#39;ll be able to drive the pirates out.&quot;

&quot;If there //is// a force of sufficient size,&quot; Darvok said, &quot;of which there is no guarantee.&quot;

&quot;We have to do //something//,&quot; the Orion cadet said, frustrated. &quot;We can&#39;t just sit here.&quot;

&quot;On the contrary, that is a perfectly viable alternative,&quot; Darvok said. &quot;This is a passenger vessel. Even if we were to find enough allies and enough firepower to re-take every deck, we have no armaments and minimal shields. We cannot fight even a weak combat vessel.&quot;

&quot;We could run,&quot; Erelan said.

&quot;Unlikely. Had we the speed necessary to do so,&quot; Darvok corrected him, &quot;we would have fled immediately.&quot;

&quot;We are fleeing now,&quot; said the Orion. &quot;You heard the captain. We&#39;re heading for ... what did you say, Procrustes?&quot;

&quot;Yes. And the attackers may be driving us there for reasons of their own.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know that.&quot;

&quot;Correct. I do not. Nevertheless, it is highly probable. They have weapons; we do not. They have speed; we do not. If they wished to prevent us from reaching Procrustes, they could, and they have not. Therefore, it is theoretically possible that we are just as safe waiting in the cabin as we would be if we attempted to purge our decks of invaders. In the short term, possibly safer, although in the long term any choice we make now might be moot.&quot;

&quot;In other words,&quot; I said, &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter what we do if they force us to crash-land on a hostile planet and we all end up dying anyway. Or they steal whatever they came to steal and blow up the ship.&quot;

&quot;Precisely.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I want to just sit around //waiting// for that,&quot; Cadet Erelan said. &quot;I still say we should drive the pirates from our deck and proceed from there. We could [[sweep the decks|BC: Sweep][$award to 1]] together, or we could [[split up,|BC: Split Up][$award to 1]] whatever works best.&quot;

&quot;Both methods are thorough,&quot; Darvok said, &quot;but also slow. We have &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[tricorders.|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;tricorder&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; If we [[use them|BC: Triangulate][$award to 1]] to detect residual &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[transporter|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;transporter&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; signatures, we could target areas to which the boarders were beamed. Or, as I said, we can [[remain here|BC: Stay]] and await further developments.&quot;

&quot;One of which might be that we all die,&quot; Erelan scowled.

&quot;And that may happen regardless,&quot; Darvok said coolly. &quot;What is your opinion, Cadet $playername?&quot;

Oh, great. They&#39;re going to make me decide.

I just held a quick meeting with Cadets Erelan and Darvok. There didn&#39;t seem to be many good options, but I asked them to lay out as many ideas as they could think of. Darvok and Erelan started brainstorming all the possibilities. Some were more practical than others, but I knew we had to concentrate on those things that we //could// do.

Erelan and Darvok were arguing about the practicality of sweeping the ship for pirates, but I had to interrupt them, as they were getting nowhere.

&quot;Quiet for a moment,&quot; I told them. &quot;Let&#39;s start with their motives. Is it likely they&#39;re trying to destroy the ship?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; the Vulcan said immediately. &quot;They would not have beamed aboard. Our destruction does not appear to be their immediate objective. Although they may seek to destroy the ship after they have attained it.&quot;

&quot;Then there&#39;s something on the ship they want,&quot; I said.

&quot;Is it the Admiral?&quot; Erelan wondered. &quot;And I heard there a political prisoner on board, or something. Perhaps there are weapons, or fuel? Warp drive parts? Maybe they&#39;re trying to steal the ship itself.&quot;

&quot;We have no way of knowing,&quot; I said. &quot;And lifeboats don&#39;t seem to be an option.&quot;

&quot;If we assume they can destroy the //Beta Centauri//, they can easily destroy lifeboats,&quot; Darvok agreed.

&quot;Then our best option is to defend our deck and try to join with any other Starfleet or security personnel. Once our deck is secure, then we go from deck to deck,&quot; I said.

&quot;That won&#39;t stop them from destroying the ship,&quot; Erelan said, frustrated. &quot;We have to //do// something.&quot;

&quot;I concur with Cadet $playername,&quot; the Vulcan said. &quot;There may not be //anything// within our power to repel the boarders, but it is certain that we can do nothing about it from //here//. We need to secure the ship.&quot;

We discussed the matter and have come up with three reasonable options.

We elected to remain in the cabin. It seemed less dangerous than roaming the corridors where there was likely to be fighting. We&#39;re only cadets, after all, not Starfleet officers.

On reflection, that might have been a mistake. Cadet Darvok and I just saw Cadet Erelan get beamed away. It didn&#39;t look like any &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[transporter|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;transporter&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; beam I&#39;ve seen, and Darvok agreed with me. It was a shower of violet particles, and it was very fast, of an unusual configurations. We tried &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[tricorder|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;tricorder&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; readings, but we didn&#39;t learn much. It was definitely a transporter, and not some kind of remote disintegration, because we didn&#39;t detect any residue.

Immediately after that, I saw Cadet Darvok get beamed away too. I have no idea where they were taken to, but I suspect I&#39;m [[about to find out|P: Wake Up]].

/:: Federation network signal unavailable
/:: Stardate timestamp unavailable&lt;/span&gt;

I have no network signal. The date is an estimate. Wherever I am, I&#39;m not on the ship.

That&#39;s the easy part.

It didn&#39;t take long before the same purple matter transmission envelope that took Darvok and Erelan also took me. I was suddenly surrounded by a warm, comfortable lavender light, and I felt a surge of power as the alien harmonics disassembled the very elements of my body. Before I blacked out, I knew: it was a transporter, but not one I had ever used before.

I woke up ... later. I don&#39;t know how much longer it was after transport. It&#39;s been a busy time, with lots of ... surprises.

I was in a room. Lying down, somewhere. A large, flat bed, bigger than a human would design. Bare accommodation for human comfort. The room was tall, too. There was a grate over the ceiling and light filtered in. There was mist of some kind in the air. It was humid, and my head was spinning.

When I sat up to recover my wits, I realized in an instant, like a thunderclap, that something was //wrong.//

&lt;&lt;if $gender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;I was a woman.&lt;&lt;set $newgender to &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;

I didn&#39;t know how it happened, or why, or ... anything else. My uniform was gone, and I was wearing a black one-piece ... skin-tight leotard, or something. A full-body suit that clung to my skin and hugged my every curve. And it cut down low in front to show off my ... my breasts.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I was a man.&lt;&lt;set $newgender to &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;

I didn&#39;t know how it happened, or why, or ... anything else. My uniform was gone, and I was wearing a black one-piece ... skin-tight leotard, or something. A full-body suit that clung to my skin and hugged all these new muscles. It was sleeveless, the better to show off my huge biceps.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It was astonishing, strange, and somehow perfectly natural at the same time. I wasn&#39;t me any more, but it didn&#39;t //feel// like I wasn&#39;t.

There was a bin in the room, where I was able to locate this &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[PADD.|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;padd&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; That&#39;s how I&#39;m making an entry now.

The PADD doesn&#39;t take the best pictures, but I don&#39;t have anything else.

I say //we// because there&#39;s someone else here, an &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Orion|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;orion&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; woman. She&#39;s asleep. I don&#39;t recognize her. She could be anyone. If whatever happened to me also happened to //her//, then she might have been a male at one time, on board the //Beta Centauri//. She -- he -- got taken from the ship, as I had, as the others had, and brought here, transformed into an Orion female. And had his sex changed, the way mine had been. It seems to be what they do here. Wherever here is.

I have to explore my [[options|P: Escape Options]]. This isn&#39;t good. Not good at all.

Cadet Allaire was in the infirmary, held at gunpoint by a suspected pirate. The pirate and appeared to be slow-witted and foolish, giggling constantly to himself, and demanding medications from the infirmary supply cabinet. He had some kind of pistol -- I don&#39;t know Pakled armaments, but it might have been a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[disruptor.|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;disruptor&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Well, well!&quot; he said. &quot;This is the first time I haven&#39;t had to wait to see the doctor!&quot;

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Zoya asked. She was backed up against the cabinets on the starboard side.

&quot;Make with the medicines, nurse girl!&quot; the Pakled demanded of her. &quot;I know you keep the expensive shit in here!&quot;

Fortunately, he could not cover both the door and Cadet Allaire, &lt;&lt;if $plural == 0&gt;&gt;and I don&#39;t think he saw us, so we&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and I don&#39;t think he saw me, so I&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; had a temporary advantage.

There wasn&#39;t time to think or consider the consequences, so I took a shot with my phaser, set for kill. My aim was good -- all that time I spent in the Academy&#39;s holodeck firing range simulator, I think. I was able to take out the offender without damage to anyone else, or to the ship. 

Still, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever shot a real person. It may take me some time to get over that. The Pakled male was threatening an unarmed person with a weapon, so I feel the action was justified, but it&#39;s still going to keep me up at night.

I did a brief search for other weapons, removed his communicator, and gave the disruptor to Cadet Allaire. She didn&#39;t have her official sidearm on her, and there was no time to go back for it. &lt;&lt;if $leader == 0&gt;&gt;She said she would remain in the infirmary,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I told her to remain in the infirmary,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; in case where were any casualties that we needed to send her way.&lt;&lt;set $inv.push(&quot;pirate communicator&quot;)&gt;&gt;

I just rushed in and tackled him without any pause to consider strategy. In any case, it worked: the threat in the infirmary has been neutralized. 

&lt;&lt;if $gender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Fortunately, the Pakled was intoxicated on something -- practically incapacitated from it -- and that made it easy for me to get him off his feet and onto the ground where his weight wasn&#39;t a factor. A few blows to the head later and he was unconscious, at least for a while.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;The Pakled was a lot bigger and heavier than I was, but we learned combat techniques to use against heavier opponents. Even so, and considering that he was practically incapacitated from some intoxicating agent or other, it was going to go badly for me.

It didn&#39;t seem worthwhile to jeopardize anybody&#39;s life over a few cabinets full of medical supplies, so I told Cadet Allaire to give the Pakled intruder whatever supplies he needed and to let him go.

&quot;That&#39;s right, little soldier,&quot; the Pakled giggled at us. &quot;You stay out of my way. I&#39;m just picking up a few things.&quot;

He gathered up some medications in one of the cabinets, stuffing them into the collar of his jacket -- as many as he could carry while still keeping his disruptor aimed at us. He wasn&#39;t even looking at labels. After a few minutes, he used his communicator and called for extraction, and he was beamed out of the infirmary, leaving only a mess of scattered ampoules and hypospray cartridges behind. At least nobody was hurt.

&lt;&lt;if $plural == 0&gt;&gt;I could see Allaire had some kind of hypospray in her hand, but she was pinned up against the starboard cabinets by the disruptor in the pirate&#39;s hand. All she needed was a distraction and we could coordinate some kind of response.

While the Pakled was concentrating on her, I motioned to Allaire what my intentions were, then I hid out of sight in the hall and rang the infirmary&#39;s door chime. I reasoned that the Pakled would turn to the door at the very least; he would take a moment to look around to see what the noise was or whether there was someone behind him. I heard him shout a warning, then I heard the sound of a hypospray, and then the Pakled hitting the floor.

When I got back into the infirmary, he was sound asleep on the deck. I did a brief search for other weapons, removed his communicator, and gave the disruptor to Cadet Allaire. She could cover him with his own weapon until we were able to deal with him properly.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I could see Allaire was pinned up against the starboard cabinets by the disruptor. We would need to draw his attention from her in order to minimize the risk. I motioned for Erelan to cover the door, while Darvok and I would go in low and take cover behind the treatment beds.

The Pakled heard us come in, and shouted something. He tried to creep toward the beds where we were concealed, but Erelan was able to come in behind him and use those big Orion muscles to arm-lock his phaser hand and drive his chin into the wall. We were able to take him out without any injury, to him or to us. I did a brief search for other weapons, removed his communicator, and gave the disruptor to Cadet Allaire.

I decided there had to be a way to end this standoff without violence. &quot;Pyria, if he wants in, let him in,&quot; I suggested. &quot;There&#39;s no use getting killed over this.&quot;

Immediately the pirate gave me a suspicious look. A moment before he had been pressing to get through the door; now he was trying to avoid doing so. &quot;Why?&quot; he demanded. &quot;What do you have in there?&quot;

&quot;Someone seeking asylum with the Federation,&quot; Cadet Pyria reported.

The pirate looked from Pyria to me and back again, and said, &quot;We have no need of him, then. Keep your asylum-seeker.&quot; He called on his communicator. &quot;Nothing here. Beam me back out.&quot; A moment later, he had been extracted from the //Beta Centauri// by his teammates.

&quot;No, it isn&#39;t,&quot; Erelan agreed. &quot;Darvok thinks there&#39;s probably an active weapon suppression field we can make use of. It would shut down weapons fire in the area. That might give us the upper hand.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $inv.includes(&quot;pirate communicator&quot;)&gt;&gt;The confiscated pirate communicator beeped in my hand, and I held it up to listen.

The ship&#39;s computer gave me some information about the forward lounge. Apparently it had a weapon suppression system designed to disable active weapons fire in the lounge, a security precaution to prevent bar fights and the like from getting out of control. If I could get into the system, I might be able to activate it, which could give me the upper hand in a confrontation.&lt;&lt;set $options[0] to 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;//Deck sixteen, that&#39;s where I am!// I thought. //I&#39;m going to have to be extra careful.//&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;engineering&quot; or $dept == &quot;security&quot; or $dept == &quot;operations&quot;&gt;&gt;Of course, I didn&#39;t know if there were any pirates in the lounge, but it was a large room where they could easily think to gather.

We encountered a single pirate in the forward lounge. We also found the Orion ambassador there.

At first, the &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Bajoran|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;bajoran&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; pirate took little notice of us. Unlike the haphazard and unkempt appearance of the others, this one had a military bearing: short hair, straight back, and clipped sentence. He had a weapon trained upon the &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Orion|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;orion&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; diplomat. Apparently they knew one another, because they were talking.

As best I can recall, their conversation went like this: &quot;Well, well, Kayus,&quot; the military pirate said. &quot;It has been some time, hasn&#39;t it?&quot;

The diplomat had his hands apart to show his non-hostile intentions. &quot;Major Hoto, I don&#39;t think you want to do this.&quot;

&quot;It has been a long time since I trusted you and your diplomacy, Kayus,&quot; the pirate said. &quot;What makes you think I won&#39;t kill you now?&quot;

&quot;You have too much sense, Major,&quot; the diplomat said smoothly. Not for nothing was he a diplomat. &quot;You operate without much restriction out here because you&#39;ve never done anything worth stirring up the fleet for.  You&#39;re not about to start.&quot;

&quot;I operate? Out here?&quot; the major sneered. &quot;Yes, out //here.// This is my place, out //here.// You have //your// place, don&#39;t you? And what a //nice// place it is. I shouldn&#39;t wonder that you&#39;ve never kept your word with me. With any of us. The Prophets know, if I had your place I wouldn&#39;t keep my word either. We wouldn&#39;t want to upset the status quo, would we?&quot;

The computer just announced we were entering standard orbit. And this military-looking pirate seemed to be working up to something. If ever there were a moment to intervene, this would be it. 

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;suppress&quot;&gt;&gt;The suppression field was on, so I could [[fight|BC: Hoto Fight][$award to 2]] the major physically without worrying about his &lt;&lt;if $inv.includes(&quot;hypospray&quot;) and $inv.includes(&quot;pirate communicator&quot;)&gt;&gt;sidearm. However, I could also try to [[sedate him|BC: Hoto Sedate][$award to 2]] with the hypospray, or use the [[pirate communicator|BC: Hoto Communicator][$award to 2]] to lure him back to his ship somehow.&lt;&lt;elseif $inv.includes(&quot;hypospray&quot;)&gt;&gt;sidearm, but I could try to [[sedate him|BC: Hoto Sedate][$award to 2]] with the hypospray.&lt;&lt;elseif $inv.includes(&quot;pirate communicator&quot;)&gt;&gt;sidearm, but I might also be able to use the [[pirate communicator|BC: Hoto Communicator][$award to 2]] to lure him back to his ship somehow.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;sidearm.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $course == &quot;contact&quot; or $course == &quot;coordinate&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;contact&quot;&gt;&gt;Darvok and Erelan were poised to enter from the other side&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Darvok and Erelan were ready for a coordinated attack&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; whenever I was ready to go. &lt;&lt;if $inv.includes(&quot;phaser&quot;)&gt;&gt;We could [[shoot to kill|BC: Hoto Shoot][$award to 2]] or [[to stun|BC: Hoto Stun][$award to 2]], or&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;We could&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; try to [[fight him|BC: Hoto Fight][$award to 2]] physically, risky though that seemed.

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;charge&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;audio addendum_beep play&gt;&gt;My first shot at Major Hoto was a little wide. I had been trying to stay to the right, to keep the Orion diplomat as far as I could from my line of fire, but I missed. It caught Major Hoto&#39;s attention, and he ran to take the elderly Orion man hostage, with his disruptor nudged into the diplomat&#39;s side.

&quot;Show yourself!&quot; the pirate called out. &quot;That was a Starfleet phaser, don&#39;t deny it. I&#39;ll kill him unless you come out.&quot;

I didn&#39;t have much choice. If I came out into the open, he would certainly kill one of us at least. I had to try to take another shot, even though he was partly concealed by the body of the diplomat.

My second shot was right on the mark. Major Hoto collapsed to the ground, and the diplomat was luckily unharmed by the disruptor.

&lt;&lt;set $comm to 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;Communications&quot;&gt;&gt;

Right after that, Darvok and Erelan came into the lounge at a run. They must have heard the gunfire. &quot;What was that?&quot; they asked. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

I verified that I was unharmed, and asked, &quot;Did you hear that? What was that noise? Why was the Admiral&#39;s signal cut off?&quot;

We were able to isolate him from the diplomat, using phaser fire to drive them apart. The pirate was too focused on returning our fire to take any action against the diplomat, who took cover when the shooting started. After only a few minutes we were able to take him down in the crossfire. He had no cover against all three of us.

&lt;&lt;if $suppression == &quot;on&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;audio addendum_beep play&gt;&gt;Major Hoto never had a chance. I was able to charge in and take him to the ground without difficulty. He had a few moments of uncertainty, and then of panic, when he tried his disruptor on me and realized it wasn&#39;t going to stop my charge. &lt;&lt;if $gender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;I may not be as big as the guys in my class, but I can still use my combat training to good effect.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I hit him pretty hard, too. He went right down to the ground.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

When we got up, he pulled a vibro-knife out of his belt. &quot;Well done, cadet,&quot; he said in a patronizing way. &quot;I didn&#39;t see you coming. But I wouldn&#39;t want this to be //too// easy for you.&quot;

About that time, Darvok and Erelan came into the lounge, ready to assist. &lt;&lt;if $inv.includes(&quot;communicator badge&quot;)&gt;&gt;They knew about the weapon suppressor already and had prepared with other weapons: a baton and a piece of pipe, by the look of it.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;They had evidently figured out that I had activated the weapon suppressor, because they had prepared with other weapons: a baton and a piece of pipe, by the look of it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;Unknown,&quot; Darvok said. I think I saw the pirate smirk.

He seemed to realize that he was not going to take on all three of us at once, and he called out on his communicator. &quot;Sandro, get me out of here.&quot;

He did not beam away that instant. His team was not prepared to extract him. Darvok, Erelan and I closed in on him, and he turned with us, trying to keep as many of us within sight as possible, but we were three and he was alone.

There was a short, ugly fight as the three of us surrounded the pirate. He was trying to face Erelan and Darvok, which allowed me to take his knife arm; a couple blows to the midsection with Erelan&#39;s baton and he lost his grip on the vibro-knife. He wrenched away, lunging low to put some distance between himself and us, calling for help again on his communicator. An instant later, he vanished in a blur of particulate yellow light as his allies beamed him away from the //Beta Centauri//.&lt;&lt;set $hoto to &quot;escaped&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $inv.push(&quot;vibro-knife&quot;)&gt;&gt;

Still, it would have gone a lot worse if Erelan and Darvok hadn&#39;t been there. &lt;&lt;if $plural == 0&gt;&gt;They arrived with their phasers out just &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;They held him off with their phasers&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; after I tackled Major Hoto, and it&#39;s a good thing they had.

I ducked outside the lounge for a moment, activated the communicator, and said hurriedly, &quot;Major Hoto! You&#39;re wanted back on the ship right away!&quot;

There was a brief pause, which felt like an eternity as I waited to hear if there would be the sound of a disruptor shot coming from the lounge. Then Hoto&#39;s voice came over the communicator: &quot;Sandro, bring me back.&quot; The sound of a transporter followed immediately afterward, and when &lt;&lt;if $plural == 0&gt;&gt;I went back into the lounge, Hoto was gone -- but Cadets Erelan and Darvok were there.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;we went back into the lounge, Hoto was gone.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Erelan asked. &quot;Where did he go?&quot;

&quot;I believe he was lured away,&quot; Darvok said, noticing the communicator in my hand, &quot;with some timely intervention by $playername.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t take him long to figure out it was a ruse,&quot; I said. &quot;We have only a few minutes to get out of the lounge.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;charge&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;audio addendum_beep play&gt;&gt;I was able to stun Major Hoto on my first shot. I felt pretty good about that, but I knew if I missed and hit the diplomat, no lasting harm would be done, so that gave me confidence. The major just toppled over, unable even to fire his disruptor.

I verified that I was unharmed, and asked, &quot;Did you hear that? What was that noise? Why was the Admiral&#39;s signal cut off?&quot;

I crept up as closely as I could to the major without drawing his attention, but I couldn&#39;t keep the diplomat&#39;s eyes from flickering in my direction. Major Hoto turned on me and tried to fire, slapping his disruptor in confusion and fear. &quot;Kheet&#39;agh,&quot; he muttered. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with this?&quot; He raised it up as if to pistol-whip me with the butt.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; I said, grabbing his arm. I pulled us together, put the hypospray up to his neck and depressed the injector. &quot;You can ask me later.&quot;

Quickly, his eyes lost focus, and he slumped to the ground, his arm coming loose from my grip. He&#39;d be out for a while, by the look of things.

&lt;&lt;if $plural == 0&gt;&gt;Erelan and Darvok came into the lounge around that time and noticed me and the diplomat with the body between us. &quot;Was that you?&quot; Erelan said. &quot;Nice work.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Erelan and Darvok congratulated me on a plan well executed. &quot;Nice work,&quot; Erelan said to me.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I have Cadet Allaire to thank for this,&quot; I said, holding up the hypospray.

&quot;Methohexitol, 2 cubic centimeters,&quot; Cadet Darvok said, noting the dose on the screen and the label on the cartridge. &quot;He should be out for two to six hours, then.&quot;

He didn&#39;t lower his disruptor, but I didn&#39;t expect him to. He kept pointing it at the diplomat. &quot;Starfleet, is it? A cadet?&quot; He chuckled condescendingly. &quot;And armed, too. You have used that phaser before, haven&#39;t you?&quot;

I tried to say something else to him, but just then he activated some kind of emergency beam-out device and transported off the deck of the ship before I could finish the question.&lt;&lt;set $hoto to &quot;escaped&quot;&gt;&gt;

I am glad you were able to intervene on my behalf.&quot;

&quot;So am I,&quot; I said. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re all right?&quot;

&quot;I am,&quot; he said pleasantly. &quot;Shaken, perhaps, but unharmed.&quot;

&quot;Who was that man?&quot; I asked. &quot;You seemed to know him.&quot;

&quot;I do. I did,&quot; the First Secretary said. &quot;Major Hoto was employed by the military on Orion at one time, handling covert operations. The secretive nature of his assignments didn&#39;t lead to the kind of, shall we say, personal glory he was hoping for. He felt inadequately compensated. I can&#39;t say more than that.&quot;

&quot;Then it is well,&quot; the First Secretary said calmly, &quot;that your aim was true.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a brig we can put him in,&quot; I said. &quot;Right now, our main priority is taking back the ship.&quot;

&quot;As it should be,&quot; the First Secretary said.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Suddenly, a cascade of violet light shimmered around Cadet Darvok. Some kind of matter transmission beam captured him. He called something to me, but it was too faint too hear. Then he was gone.

A moment later, Cadet Erelan vanished in a similar shower of violet particles. I couldn&#39;t get a tricorder reading, it happened so fast.

&quot;What&#39;s happened?&quot; I asked, alarmed. &quot;Where have they gone?&quot;

&quot;It was not the same transporter as Major Hoto used,&quot; the diplomat said. &quot;If indeed--&quot;

And then he too, was beamed away.

I have no idea where they went. But I have a feeling that before long I am going to [[find out.|P: Wake Up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="P: Escape Options" tags="" position="425,650" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $audio == &quot;on&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;audio sameday_beep play&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $lastpage to $thispage&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $thispage to &quot;P: Escape Options&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;Menu Top&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $add += 1&gt;&gt;

I woke up the Orion woman in my cell. It turned out to be Darvok.

When I woke her up, she seemed slow, as if she were trying to get her bearings. I remember the feeling, and I let her have a few seconds. &quot;Hello,&quot; I said the green-skinned woman. &quot;Did you come down from the //Beta Centauri// too?&quot;

The unfamiliar woman pressed her hand to her temple, as if to dispel her disorientation, and noticed her own green skin for the first time. Then she cast her gaze down upon her strange new curves, the ones she had never seen before.

&quot;Did you get made into a &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;woman, too?&quot; I asked her. My voice sounded strangely light and feminine in my ears.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;woman, like I got changed into a man?&quot; I asked her. My voice sounded deep and rumbling in my ears.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;I know how you feel. My name is Cadet $playername, I&#39;m in Starfleet Academy.&quot;

&quot;Cadet $playername?&quot; The Orion woman looked up alertly at me. &quot;It is difficult to believe, but it appears to be you. The same, but ... different. You managed to remain human. I believe I have been converted to an &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Orion|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;orion&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; female, if skin color is any indication.&quot; The cool-headed rational speech and the calm reaction to an impossible transformation told me that I was dealing with a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Vulcan,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;vulcan&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; but she confirmed it a moment later by introducing herself as Darvok.

&quot;I saw you and Erelan get beamed away,&quot; I explained. &quot;Although this isn&#39;t like any transporter technology I&#39;ve ever seen before.&quot;

&quot;Was it only the Starfleet personnel, or were there others, I wonder,&quot; Darvok mused aloud.

&quot;I didn&#39;t see any of the //Beta//&#39;s crew get taken,&quot; I said, &quot;but I didn&#39;t see any on our deck at all, either.&quot;

Darvok nodded, her long green-black hair falling into her eyes. &quot;My present hypothesis is...&quot; She hesitated. &quot;I apologize. This change is disorienting. At present I believe we were beamed down to the planet by beings unknown. That is lamentably obvious, as hypotheses go.&quot;

&quot;What makes you think so?&quot;

&quot;This cell shows no signs of spaceworthy engineering,&quot; she pointed out. &quot;There are no air circulation vents. The materials are solid, possibly shaped stone or mineral composite, rather than lightweight aerospace material. And the use of space is wasteful.&quot; She rubbed her hands together, staring at them. &quot;Also, I do not believe this to be pirate technology. Had they possessed it, they would be more likely to have left us on our ship, or taken us to theirs. This...&quot; she paused for thought again, struggling for words. I could see the confusion on her face. &quot;This is not certain. I cannot tell if my mind is functioning the same as it had been.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; I asked her. &quot;I know this isn&#39;t easy, but we have to get through this.&quot;

The Orion woman nodded wearily. &quot;I understand, $playername. This is a strange burden, and I fear worse is to come. My people have a limited telepathic ability, but with the physiological alteration, I fear that power may have been taken from me.&quot;

&quot;We will have to simply deal with the changes for now,&quot; I told Darvok.  &quot;Our first priority is escape.&quot;

&quot;Agreed,&quot; she replied. &quot;Please, just give me just a moment, and I will be ready. It is so very strange, becoming an Orion female. I never previously grasped how intimately connected with their senses the Orions were. Are. Their minds are so awash in sensation and emotion.&quot;

Then she noticed the &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[PADD|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;padd&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; I was carrying. &quot;Is that a data PADD?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;There&#39;s no network signal.&quot;

&quot;Understood. I would like to borrow it,&quot; she said. &quot;If you have found any of our other equipment, let us review what we have. I need to think for a few moments.&quot;

I had never heard a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Vulcan|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;vulcan&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; who needed [[time to think|P: Escape Options 2]], but it was just the beginning of a very strange day. I lent her the PADD and let her review the data we had, including my personal logs.

Darvok gave me the PADD again, and sat on her bunk, rubbing her green forehead. &quot;I am glad you were making such a good record of the events,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe my prior assessment is correct. This is likely to be the planet &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Procrustes.|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;procrustes&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; It was located near the space lane where our ship was attacked.&quot; She sighed, and added, &quot;Probably.&quot;

&quot;Probably?&quot;

She nodded wearily. &quot;I trust my prior estimate. I ... cannot repeat it at the moment.&quot;

&quot;I thought Procrustes was an uninhabited ruin.&quot;

&quot;It is possible that this is no longer the case,&quot; Darvok said. &quot;Furthermore, if this is some kind of planetary defense set up by the Procrusteans, a booby trap for unwanted visitors, it now seems obvious why the planet was listed as Contact Prohibited.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;I indicated my suddenly altered physique -- the strange new smallness of it, the unaccustomed curves, the delicate vulnerability.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I indicated my suddenly altered physique -- the strange new masculine size of it, the unaccustomed muscles, the odd feeling of bulk and inflexibility.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;Darvok, how is this possible? Have you ever heard of a transformation such as this?  How can technology such as this exist, and we have never heard of it?&quot;

&quot;I admit I have no clear idea, yet,&quot; she replied. &quot;That it is very advanced, yet we have not heard of any research even remotely like it, is good reason to think it is ancient rather than modern. This ... process would have come from years, perhaps decades, of expensive and thorough multi-disciplinary research. It would have crossed technology boundaries of biology, cross-species genetics, transporters, replicators, perhaps others, yet I know of no such research.&quot;

&quot;Can you be sure the pirates didn&#39;t invent it?&quot;

&quot;I cannot,&quot; she conceded. &quot;However, there is no good reason to suspect it came from a band of disorganized raiders surviving on subpar technology out in deep space. Still, even if they did not invent the technology, perhaps they knew of it. They may have attacked us in this vicinity deliberately, intending for us to flee -- here. It is very likely that they knew this would happen.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to be on our guard,&quot; I said grimly. &quot;They&#39;ve got to be around here somewhere.&quot;

&quot;It is not certain that they--&quot; Again, the Orion woman struggled to put her logic into words. Frustration, confusion and exhaustion played across her lovely features. She marshaled her thoughts, visibly struggling to use an emotional Orion brain to perform disciplined Vulcan logic. &quot;They may not come. The pirates might have coralled us toward Procrustes, yes, but they may not need to, or intend to, follow us to the surface. Their objective may simply be to secure the ship. After all, the Procrustean &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[transporters|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;transporter&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; would have eliminated any remaining defensive personnel.&quot;

&quot;So it was a trap,&quot; I concluded. &quot;They were using the planetary defenses to help them steal the ship.&quot;

&quot;It is a likely supposition. At the initial point of contact, the pirate vessel engaged us with standard weapons,&quot; Darvok reminded me. &quot;It wasn&#39;t until we entered standard orbit that we were beamed off the ship. If the pirates had the technology to separate the ship from all its passengers and crew, they would likely have used it sooner.&quot;

I could see her slump over wearily, again rubbing her temples. She seemed on the very verge of crying, and only tremendous effort was holding back her tears. I sat down beside her without thinking and put my arm around her shoulders. It was a very natural thing to do, to give her comfort, and it took me a moment to wonder whether that was my old instincts at work, or if I suddenly had new ones. I had to say something to her, I just didn&#39;t know what. She needed encouragement. I didn&#39;t want to tell her that she seemed [[too weak|P: Escape Options 3][$course to &quot;weak&quot;]] to handle the monumental task ahead of us. Resisting the new biology she had been given would be a struggle and she would have to [[fight it|P: Escape Options 3][$course to &quot;fight&quot;]] every step of the way. Perhaps it would be better to [[accept it|P: Escape Options 3][$course to &quot;accept&quot;]] her new nature for the time being. There didn&#39;t seem to be much alternative.

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;fight&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Your mind is Vulcan,&quot; I reminded her gently. &quot;No matter what they might have done to your body, your mind is your own.  You can resist these changes.&quot;&lt;&lt;set $ach.push(&quot;Darvok fights&quot;)&gt;&gt;

&quot;I ... feel ... that I must try,&quot; she agreed. &quot;We shall all need to be at our best if we are to escape.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $course == &quot;weak&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;You can do better than this, Darvok,&quot; I said encouragingly to her. &quot;I know how mentally strong Vulcans are. If you can&#39;t handle a minor little change like this, you don&#39;t deserve to be called one.&quot;&lt;&lt;set $ach.push(&quot;Darvok weak&quot;)&gt;&gt;

&quot;Thank you, $playername,&quot; she says in a faint voice. &quot;That is clear enough. I will do my best.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $course == &quot;accept&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Your people have great mental discipline, Darvok,&quot; I told her gently, &quot;but you do have feelings. Perhaps you should look upon this as an opportunity to experience those feelings. They are, after all, quite natural -- not for a Vulcan, perhaps, but certainly for an Orion.&quot;&lt;&lt;set $ach.push(&quot;Darvok adapts&quot;)&gt;&gt;

Darvok closed her eyes for a moment, absorbing that. &quot;It is a reasonable position,&quot; she said, opening them at last. &quot;I suppose in the absence of a remedy, it seems the path of least resistance.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

I rubbed her shoulders with one arm, trying to coax her back to some kind of stability. She sniffled once or twice, and I could see her eyes were bright, but she hadn&#39;t wept. There was enough Vulcan self-control left, just enough ... for now.

&quot;Thank you, $playername,&quot; she said. She rubbed her eyes and sat up straight. &quot;I believe I am ready to proceed.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; I said. &quot;Now how do we get out of here?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;security&quot; or $dept == &quot;engineering&quot; or $dept == &quot;science&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;If the door does not open on its own,&quot; Darvok said, &quot;then I recommend we try to alter its circuit pathways until it does. We ought to be able to [[disassemble the panel|P: Escape Cell][$course to &quot;panel&quot;]] by the door and force it open.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I recommend we [[use your PADD|P: Escape Cell][$course to &quot;padd&quot;]] to attempt to interface with any local networks,&quot; Darvok said. &quot;We can use the power supply from our communicators to boost the signal range. If the PADD can negotiate a suitable interface with the alien computer, we might gain enough access to force the doors to open.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;panel&quot;&gt;&gt;Between the two of us, we were able to disassemble the door panel and examine the mechanism. It was alien technology, but wires are wires, circuits are circuits, and door security is much the same everywhere. It took only a few minutes of experimentation, and then there was a hiss from the door as the hydraulic locks retracted.

&quot;Well done, $playername,&quot; Darvok said to me, with a slight smile on her face. Then the smile vanished.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Between the two of us, we were able to use the PADD to connect to an alien network. After we made our modifications, it took a few seconds for the data pad to scan the broadcast frequencies in its range. It connected to a local band, and several seconds passed as the data pad sought for a compatible communication protocol.

&quot;It may be too modern for this ancient computer system,&quot; my cellmate observed. &quot;But it was designed to interface with the computer systems of many different starfaring peoples.&quot;

At last the data pad showed an interface screen, but it had no recognizable text or characters whatever. The translation software did its best to translate the communication protocol. Translating the actual command functions was left as an exercise for the user.

&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to make use of full access,&quot; I explained. &quot;But I believe we can open the door.&quot;

&quot;It will be sufficient,&quot; she says placidly.

I found a function that looked as if it might be a plan view of the facility, with a long, arced hallway and several cells adjoining it. Which door control is it? //Ah, it must be this one!// I thought, and tried it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

The door slid open, and a figure pushed his way in, bringing with him a reek of industrial lubricant and stale sweat. This pistol-packing human appeared to be one of the pirates that attacked the //Beta Centauri//. He saw &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;us&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Darvok&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;, and his face broke into a thoroughly unpleasant smile.

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;I was suddenly acutely aware of my new feminine figure. I am now entirely female, with a fine body, and this disreputable lech doesn&#39;t realize -- or does he?

&quot;Oh ho!&quot; he said, throwing a lingering look down my curves, then over to the apparently Orion features of Cadet Darvok. He waggled his gun at us. &quot;I sure hope one of you is Lekos. Hell, even you&#39;re not, I might have to take you with me anyway.&quot; The pirate ogled my brand-new curves, his roving eyes covering every centimeter of my new flesh. &quot;Don&#39;t be scared, sweet cakes, this happens to everybody. You might even like being a woman after a while.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;With a shock, I suddenly realized he was not looking at //me//, but at the fine feminine figure of Darvok. This disreputable lech doesn&#39;t realize that Darvok isn&#39;t really a woman -- or does he?

&quot;Oh ho!&quot; he said, throwing a lingering look down my apparently Orion friend&#39;s curves. He waggled his gun at her, barely even noticing me. &quot;I sure hope one you&#39;re Lekos. Hell, even you&#39;re not, I might have to take you with me anyway.&quot; The pirate &#39;s roving eyes covering every centimeter of her new flesh. It was as if I weren&#39;t even there. &quot;Don&#39;t be scared, sweet cakes, this happens to everybody. You might even like being a woman after a while.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

There was no time to think. &lt;&lt;if $inv.includes(&quot;vibro-knife&quot;)&gt;&gt;We had no phaser, only a [[vibro-knife,|P: Knife]] and there was no escape from this cell except through him.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;We had no weapons, and there was no escape from this cell except through him.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;I would have to disarm him, then &lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t know if I had any muscles left, but I would have to try to &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;[[fight him|P: Fight Pirate]] with my bare hands.

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;I tried to tense my muscles -- what was left of them -- and leapt to attack the pirate with my tiny fists, but the transformation of my body had depleted all my masculine strength. I ran into the pirate and bounced off, like a butterfly hitting a brick. My new body was tiny. I had no mass, no muscle, no leverage. I was incapable of moving him. I rained down as many puny, ineffective blows onto his chest and shoulders as I could, but it only seemed to hurt my hands and to bring a smile to his face.

Finally, he pushed me away with one powerfully strong arm, and I was thrown back into the cell. He chuckled at me, amused. &quot;You got it figured out now, sweet cakes? You ain&#39;t a man no more. Fighting ain&#39;t no use.&quot;

&quot;So you do know about the Procrustean defense system,&quot; Darvok said. There was an un-Vulcan-like nervous tension in her voice.

&quot;Sure, of course,&quot; the pirate said, checking out Darvok&#39;s voluptuous new body. He pushed me away again as I tried to mount another spirited but futile attack. &quot;Come on, baby, do that again,&quot; he said to me in what he probably presumed was a seductive manner. &quot;I like it when they fight.&quot;

&quot;What are you going to do with us?&quot; I panted. I didn&#39;t have much strength left to fight.

&quot;You figure it out,&quot; the man said with an evil laugh. &quot;I&#39;m just looking for Lekos, and then we&#39;re leaving. If you&#39;re not him, maybe you&#39;re just as good.  What do you say?&quot;

He grabbed my slender little wrist in one of his huge paws. I tried to claw his fingers open, but he simply added my other wrist to his grip. With both of my hands pinned. he started to drag me out of the cell. I could not resist him, though I tried with all my might to stiffen my legs and push against the floor. He was just too powerful. Darvok tried to help as well; she stood up and grasped his shoulder in the dreaded Vulcan neck pinch, but a Orion woman&#39;s fingers aren&#39;t strong enough for that maneuver. &quot;Oh, you want to go too?&quot; he said, holstering his gun. With his other arm he grabbed Darvok around her slender waist. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $prowess lt 900&gt;&gt;There didn&#39;t seem to be anything else to do except [[scream for help.|P: Scream]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;A frontal attack had failed. I no longer possessed the kind of raw muscle that I was accustomed to. Perhaps [[superior training|P: Training]] would make the difference. It seemed better at this point than simply [[screaming for help|P: Scream]] like a girl.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;display &quot;Bravery&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;I bunched my muscles for a mighty swing, and delivered a solid punch to the pirate&#39;s chest. With this new male physique, I guess I&#39;m much stronger than I&#39;ve ever been before, and the blow knocks the wind out of him completely. I can feel the shock of it all the way to my shoulder, and it feels ... good to finally let loose one strong, solid punch.

One more right to the jaw, and the pirate went down to the floor, unconscious.

//Thank goodness for muscles,// I thought to myself. There&#39;s a strange sense of satisfaction at having taken the man down, and I felt ... proud? I guess I was really proud to have defended Darvok from his attention. It was a strange discovery.

&quot;Come on,&quot; I told Darvok. &quot;Time to leave.&quot;

As if she had been waiting for a man&#39;s permission, she stood up from her bunk, one hand tucked demurely into the other and held low in front of her.

I led her into the hall. The alien construction was here, too: massive wedge-shaped hallways, wider at the top than the bottom, with some complex lighted grate overhead. The passageway arced in both directions, as if the hallway were part of a larger circle. Other doors, which I presumed were cells like ours, were dotted here and there along the walls. All were shut.

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 1 and $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;There were two figures further down the corridor, both males, both dressed in head-to-toe black jumpsuits as we were. One was a huge hulking &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Klingon|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;klingon&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; with brown skin and a craggy forehead, and the other was a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Bajoran|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;bajoran&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; male with an annoyed scowl on his face. They didn&#39;t seem to be pirates, so I waved to them.

They muttered something to each other, then joined us in the hall outside our cell. &quot;One of the pirates, eh?&quot; the Bajoran man said, after glancing into the cell and seeing the collapsed figure of the leering man I had just knocked out. &quot;Are you two okay?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;There was a figure further down the corridor, a male dressed in a head-to-toe black jumpsuit the same as we were. He was a huge hulking &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Klingon|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;klingon&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; with brown skin and a craggy forehead. He didn&#39;t seem to be one of the pirates, so I waved to him.

He joined us in the hall outside our cell, glancing in and noticing the collapsed form of the leering pirate I had just knocked out. &quot;Nice work, the Klingon said. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;There was a figure further down the corridor, a male dressed in a head-to-toe black jumpsuit the same as we were. He was a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Bajoran|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;bajoran&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; male with an annoyed scowl on his face. He didn&#39;t seem to be one of the pirates, so I waved to him.

He joined us in the hall outside our cell. &quot;One of the pirates, eh?&quot; the Bajoran man said, after glancing into the cell and seeing the collapsed figure of the leering man I had just knocked out. &quot;Are you two okay?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t see anyone else,&quot; I said, glancing in either direction.

&quot;It would still be well to keep your voice low,&quot; Darvok advised me. &quot;There may be others nearby.&quot;

I nodded, and prepared to head down the corridor, but she took my hand and stopped me. &quot;Yes?&quot; I asked, turning back to her.

Darvok&#39;s green Orion features were looking back at me, eyes large and liquid. &quot;$playername, I feel I should thank you for rescuing me. It is a strange thing to suddenly discover I am ... peculiarly vulnerable in this state.&quot; Her eyes dropped, ashamed, to her black-clad female figure. &quot;I have the training of a cadet and the memories of a Vulcan, but suddenly I have the instincts of an Orion female.&quot;

&quot;This situation is new to me, too,&quot; I reminded her, taking her small shoulder in my unusually large hand. &quot;We&#39;ll get through it somehow.&quot;

&quot;We will,&quot; Darvok says, and shudders in relief. &quot;Thank you again for saving me.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $surv gt 2&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; Darvok said plainly. The terse, matter-of-fact tone had gone from her voice, to be replaced by weariness and anxiety. &quot;I presume you are also from the //Beta Centauri//?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[1] == 1 and $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; the Bajoran man answered. &quot;I&#39;m Cadet Zoya Allaire of Starfleet. This is Cadet Pyria Calinor.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; the Bajoran man answered. &quot;I&#39;m Cadet Zoya Allaire of Starfleet.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I am,&quot; the Klingon man replied. &quot;Cadet Pyria Calinor of Starfleet Academy. Call me Cadet Pyria. It&#39;s a ... a Bajoran thing.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I&#39;m really glad it&#39;s you,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;m $playername, and this is Darvok. You can probably guess that we&#39;re having just as strange a day as you are.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;Allaire, the Bajoran male, was running his medical scanner over us -- Starfleet issue, of course. &quot;That&#39;s an understatement,&quot; he said dryly. &quot;That&#39;s a new look for you, isn&#39;t it, $playername?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Pyria, the Klingon male, nodded curtly. &quot;Undoubtedly, yes. You two are as changed as I. Perhaps it is different with you, but I find it ... rather difficult so far.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;This is a strange place to find ourselves, for sure,&quot; I said, as I tried to look in both directions down the corridor. Beside me, Darvok checked her tricorder. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to figure out what to do next if we&#39;re going to get out of this place.&quot;

&quot;Get out?&quot; Darvok asked blankly. &quot;Get out? Surely we must find a way to reverse this, this ...&quot; She was starting to panic, and I wrapped my arms around her to calm her down. Her rapid breathing gradually slowed down. &quot;I apologize,&quot; she said in a tremulous whisper. &quot;This is ... difficult. Why are you not experiencing problems of adaptation as I am? Are you enjoying this?&quot;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;
I hadn&#39;t had time to stop and think about it. The experience was still so new and so unfamiliar that I hadn&#39;t had time to really assess what would happen if I were stuck this way for -- for a while, perhaps forever. Perhaps what had been done could not be undone?

In some ways, I could see how women might [[love|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;love&quot;]] being a man, having the power and the independence; it could be a great [[opportunity|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;opportunity&quot;]] to see how the other half lived, and I could probably [[get used to it|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;adapt&quot;]] eventually. On the other hand, this new body was strange, and there were sure to be [[awkward|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;awkward&quot;]] times ahead, and the more I thought about it, it would be [[bizarre|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;bizarre&quot;]] to have to explain this to my family.

__ Personal log, stardate 48446, time unknown, addendum $add __
Instinctively, I let out a frightened, feminine, blood-curdling shriek of terror. It echoed through the halls beyond the cell and rebounded down the corridors. It wasn&#39;t the most masculine thing I could have done, and it was embarrassing as hell, but it was the only chance I had.

This amused the pirate even more. &quot;Hey, I like &#39;em when they scream,&quot; he said, pulling us into the corridor. &quot;It makes it interesting.&quot;

I didn&#39;t have much time to take in our surroundings. I was too focused on escaping his iron grip. &quot;Hey, who&#39;d you used to be?&quot; he asked us. &quot;A captain, maybe? A tourist? Some ... I dunno ... some mechanic or something?&quot; He gurgled a satisfied laugh. &quot;Not any more.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 1 and $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;But suddenly we were not alone in the corridor. Two figures, dressed in black neck-to-toe jumpsuits just as Darvok and I were, appeared out of nowhere and grabbed at the pirate&#39;s collar. One of the figures was a massive Klingon male with a craggy face and brown skin, and the other was an Bajoran male with a look of fury.  The pirate let us go, and Darvok tumbled away, catching her balance against a wall. I could only watch in fright, backing away from the fighting men.

The pirate tried to go for his holstered disruptor, but the Klingon grabbed his gun arm and pulled it back in an armlock until the elbow creaked and the shoulder popped out of its joint. As the pirate let out a hoarse, pathetic whimper, the Bajoran stepped in with his fists and threw down down blow after blow on the pirate&#39;s defenseless head and throat.

The pirate didn&#39;t withstand this punishment long, and after a moment it was clear no more punishment was necessary. The body was limp in the Klingon&#39;s grip, and the Klingon simply tossed him to one side where he crumpled into a heap. &quot;I could get used to this,&quot; he said to the Bajoran.

&quot;It&#39;ll take me a while,&quot; the Bajoran muttered, and turned to us. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;Then there was another figure in the corridor, a massive hulking Klingon male that seemed to blot out the light. Like me, he was dressed in a black neck-to-toe jumpsuit. A look of studied focus was on his craggy brown face, as he gripped the pirate&#39;s collar with his massive left hand, while his equally ominous right fist came in straight from the shoulder.

It only takes one punch, and the pirate slithers to the floor, out cold. Darvok tumbled loose from his grip, catching her balance against a wall.

The Klingon turned to us, quickly assessing us for injuries. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;Then there was another figure in the corridor, a Bajoran male with a look of desperate fury. Like me, he was dressed in a black neck-to-toe jumpsuit. He lashed out with one foot at the pirate&#39;s knee, and there was a sickening crack. The pirate went down, Darvok tumbled loose, and the Bajoran man moved in with his fists.

But there was nothing left to do. The pirate has cracked his head on the floor of the corridor, and was now unconscious. All the fight had gone out of him.

The Bajoran turned to us. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I screamed again, more desperately this time, and my feminine voice echoed in the alien halls. Darvok added her voice to mine, but there was no help coming from anywhere. We were [[alone|P: Captured]].&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $surv gt 2&gt;&gt;

&quot;I want to thank you,&quot; I said to &lt;&lt;if $surv == 4&gt;&gt;the unfamiliar men.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;the unfamiliar man.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;From the bottom of my heart. If you hadn&#39;t come along ...&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[1] == 1 and $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Well, we did, and I&#39;m glad,&quot; the Bajoran said. With a practiced ease, he took my wrist and felt the bones. &quot;Not sore? Good. I don&#39;t think he hurt you. I&#39;m ... I&#39;m Cadet Allaire,&quot; he said, pausing awkwardly.

&quot;Zoya Allaire?&quot; I asked wryly, as he ran his medical scanner -- Starfleet issue, of course -- over my feminine form. &quot;I should have known.&quot;

&quot;Yes, from Starfleet Academy,&quot; he said, giving me an odd look. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I seem a little out of sorts -- this place sort of does that to you. What is your name?&quot;

I tried to clear my throat of the feminine tones it produced, but failed.  &quot;Zoya, it&#39;s me,&quot; I explained, feeling a bit sheepish and embarrassed to be caught in this peculiarly female condition. &quot;Cadet $playerfirst $playername, in the flesh.&quot;

The Klingon male laughed strangely -- deep, yet light. &quot;Well, well. Cadet $playername. This is a new look for you,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m Cadet Pyria. Somehow you managed to stay human. Fortunately, Allaire here managed to turn into an Bajoran. It&#39;s an improvement.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a Klingon now, Pyria?&quot; I asked, staring up the length of Pyria&#39;s new male body in astonishment. &quot;Incredible.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not the half of it,&quot; he said. &quot;But I have these muscles now, I guess, and they came in handy a minute ago, so I won&#39;t complain.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say! I&#39;m just lucky you were here,&quot; I said. I had a feeling that I was gushing appreciatively in a very feminine way, but I couldn&#39;t help it. &quot;I could have been ...&quot;

&quot;But you weren&#39;t,&quot; Allaire said comfortingly, checking Darvok with his medical tricorder. &quot;It would be a terribly rude introduction to womanhood, and I&#39;m glad you missed out on it. Apart from that, though, it&#39;s tremendously interesting from a medical standpoint. What do you think of the idea of being a woman for a while?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I did, fortunately for you,&quot; the Klingon said. He sounded gruff but pleased. &quot;I&#39;m Cadet Pyria,&quot; he said, introducing himself. &quot;And you?&quot;

I tried to clear my throat of the feminine tones it produced, but failed.  &quot;Pyria, it&#39;s me,&quot; I explained, feeling a bit sheepish and embarrassed to be caught in this peculiarly female condition. &quot;Cadet $playerfirst $playername, in the flesh.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say! I&#39;m just lucky you were here,&quot; I said. I had a feeling that I was gushing appreciatively in a very feminine way, but I couldn&#39;t help it. &quot;I could have been ...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think about it now,&quot; Pyria commanded me. &quot;There&#39;s no time to worry about what might have been. We have enough just to consider what //is//, and what to do about it. If we cannot reverse this ... all //this//,&quot; he said, gesturing at himself, &quot;How do you feel about being a woman for a time?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Well, I did, and I&#39;m glad,&quot; the Bajoran said. With a practiced ease, he took my wrist and felt the bones. &quot;Not sore? Good. I don&#39;t think he hurt you. I&#39;m ... I&#39;m Cadet Allaire,&quot; he said, pausing awkwardly.

&quot;And what flesh,&quot; Cadet Allaire said with a wry smile. &quot;No, no, I know, it&#39;s too soon for jokes. At least you remained human, so look at the bright side.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re Bajoran,&quot; I said in amazement, staring at Zoya Allaire&#39;s new masculine features. They were hers ... but also his. &quot;Incredible.&quot;

&quot;I could say the same to you,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m just glad I have these muscles, because otherwise I might not have had the chance.&quot;

&quot;Thank you again for being there. You were right in the nick of time,&quot; I said. I had a feeling that I was gushing appreciatively in a very feminine way, but I couldn&#39;t help it. &quot;If you hadn&#39;t been there ...&quot;

&quot;But I was, and I&#39;m glad for you that I was,&quot; Allaire said comfortingly, checking Darvok with his medical tricorder. &quot;It would be a terribly rude introduction to womanhood, and I&#39;m glad you missed out on it.

In some ways, I could see how some men might [[love|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;love&quot;]] being a woman. It was so different, so liberating, to be free of the expectations of masculine roles.

__ Personal log, stardate unknown __
I have no idea how long ago we were captured by the pirates. I want to say years, but maybe it&#39;s been months. I can&#39;t tell any more.

They kept us in their harem on board the ship for a while. That amused them. Eventually they found out we had been Starfleet cadets, and that amused them even more. They fucked us every chance they got. When they were feeling lusty, or bored, or triumphant, or ... 

At first I didn&#39;t like it. At first I just closed my eyes and tried to pretend it wasn&#39;t happening. But it was.

Some of the pirates used to be rough with us, but not for long. If we get abused, then ... well, they aren&#39;t allowed to see us. We&#39;re too valuable a commodity to let the boys abuse us too badly. If we turn up with our pretty faces bruised, that seems to upset &lt;&lt;if $hoto == &quot;escaped&quot; or $hoto == &quot;sedated&quot; or $hoto == &quot;lured away&quot;&gt;&gt;them, especially Major Hoto.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;them, especially their new captain.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; The rough boys get punished. I don&#39;t know what happens to them. Maybe the pirates drop those boys off at Procrustes for a quick dose of ... no, that&#39;s wishful thinking. All I know is I never see them again.

It&#39;s taken a while, but now we&#39;re treated with some respect. Some kindness. Pirates want our favors, our best attentions. That gives us a little power. Darvok and I learned to wield it as best we could: we say we like this pirate, not that one. It gives us a tiny bit of leverage over them. And some of the pirates, we really do like ... the ones who treat us well. The ones who ...

The sex is better now. It took a while. We had to have some control for that to happen. It wasn&#39;t always good, but now it&#39;s much better than ... than before.

I wonder if Starfleet Academy ever stopped looking for us.

&quot;Curious,&quot; Darvok said with a faint smile. &quot;I cannot say I had always hoped for the opportunity to be a woman, personally.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;opportunity&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a great opportunity,&quot; I said with a smile. &quot;Who hasn&#39;t ever wondered what it would be like to be the opposite sex?&quot;

&quot;Not I,&quot; Darvok replied candidly.  &quot;Curious.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;adapt&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s strange, but not bad,&quot; I said. &quot;I can get used to this eventually. It&#39;ll take a bit of time to get used to the extra height and muscles.&quot;

&quot;An admirable hope,&quot; Darvok said. &quot;I would prefer to find a solution to this -- peculiar alteration.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;awkward&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a bit awkward,&quot; I complained. &quot;I&#39;m too big and tall, I&#39;ve got all these muscles, I feel really thick and inflexible. I&#39;d rather just change back, I guess.&quot;

&quot;As would I, $playername,&quot; Darvok sighed. &quot;As would I.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;bizarre&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s just too bizarre,&quot; I said with distaste. &quot;How do you guys handle being this big, and having this ... this //thing// down there, between your legs? The sooner we find a way to change back, the better.&quot;

&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Darvok.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;hate&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I hate it,&quot; I complained. &quot;I can&#39;t stand being a man. I&#39;m too hairy, I&#39;m too heavy -- I&#39;m never going to get used to this. I can&#39;t stand this another minute!&quot;

&quot;I understand completely, $playername,&quot; Darvok sighed.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;love&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I love it!&quot; I said enthusiastically. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to really get into it. This is going to be a lot of fun -- I&#39;ve always wanted to know what this was like!&quot;

&quot;You almost did,&quot; Darvok said grimly. &quot;I&#39;m glad someone was here to protect you.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;opportunity&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I think it&#39;s a great opportunity,&quot; I admitted. &quot;It&#39;s the only way we&#39;ll ever truly know what it&#39;s like to be ... different. I believe we&#39;ll learn a lot.&quot;

&quot;We may learn things we&#39;d rather not have to know,&quot; Darvok said glumly. &quot;I hope someday to have as optimistic an outlook as you.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;adapt&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s strange,&quot; I said. &quot;I suppose I&#39;ll get used to it eventually -- ask me later.&quot;

Darvok nods. &quot;I hope I shall get the chance.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;awkward&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;This feels really awkward,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;ve been all ... rearranged. My body is soft and curvy, and I have no muscles at all. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m going to enjoy this at all.&quot;

&quot;Nor I,&quot; Darvok said. &quot;Unless we can reverse this process, we may have no choice.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;bizarre&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;This is too bizarre for me,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;m not supposed to be shaped like //this//. I have breasts? I&#39;m female? I can get pregnant, and all of that? It&#39;s too much of a change, too soon.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I understand your alarm,&quot; Pyria said, &quot;but relax. It isn&#39;t the end of the world.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not that bad,&quot; Allaire said with a warm smile. &quot;But perhaps I got off a little more easily than you.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;hate&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I hate this,&quot; I said with a shudder. &quot;Being a woman is terrible so far! I&#39;ve been unmanned, I&#39;m weak, I&#39;m tiny --I can&#39;t even defend myself! We need to find a device to change us back, right away.&quot;

&quot;I concur completely,&quot; Darvok assured me.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 1 and $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;Allaire and Pyria were looking around. &quot;Where are we?&quot; Pyria asked. &quot;Is this the planet? What planet is this?&quot;

&quot;We think it might be Procrustes,&quot; I explained. &quot;Darvok thought it might have been close to our position at the time of the attack.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know that world,&quot; Allaire confessed. &quot;What is it?&quot;

I didn&#39;t have much to tell them, so I kept it short: uninhabited ruins of an ancient civilization. The boys took it all in, nodding and looking around warily. They looked as if they were eager to get moving.

Darvok noticed this, and asked timidly, &quot;Where do we go now?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s split up,&quot; I said. &quot;You two go that way, Darvok and I will go this way.

We found a security station. Darvok is busy examining it. I took the opportunity to complete these personal logs to use as a reference. A lot has happened in the last hour, most of it confusing and strange, and I needed to get it recorded.

This was a big control room of some kind. There were a few doors here that led to other parts of the facility, but we were focusing on a computer station. I&#39;d never seen one set up in this fashion. It must have been designed by an intelligence so alien, or so long forgotten by history, that nobody had ever studied anything like it. Even Darvok was perplexed by it. One dusty monitor seemed to show an overhead map view of our present location, with a number of cells connected to a ring-like corridor. Those must be cells similar to the one Darvok and I escaped from.

The device has two major function selections, but Darvok is still trying to work out what they do. Of course we couldn&#39;t use my PADD to assist in translation, as there&#39;s no network signal handy. 

From here, I could control a number of screens that depicted other people dressed like Darvok and me: black jumpsuits. Most were asleep in their cells, but some were awake, pounding on their doors; some were huddled in the corner, trying to ignore what had happened to them. Others were ... curious about their changes. I didn&#39;t feel good about watching them. Besides, there was no way to know who any of them were. If they had been changed as much as I had, or Darvok had, the people in those cells could be anybody. The Klingon captain ... the Admiral ... &lt;&lt;if $survivors[3] == 1&gt;&gt;Cadet Erelan ... &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 0&gt;&gt;Cadet Pyria ... &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $survivors[1] == 0&gt;&gt;Cadet Allaire ... &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; really, any passenger or crew member caught in the Procrustean defense system.

She&#39;s figured out one of the functions, and turned off a noisy alarm. Our escape hadn&#39;t gone unnoticed, and some automatic alert system must have been triggered.

I&#39;ll [[log again|P: Choices]] when we know a few more things.

Whether there are others on Procrustes, we can&#39;t be sure. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;Darvok and I had a moment to confer, so we reviewed our options. According to her analysis of the computer console and the facility map, there were a number of things we could try to do.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we were still getting used to all of my/our bodies, so I/we weren&#39;t very good at helping out, but Darvok told me/us a couple of things that could still be tried.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;engineering&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;If I brought you my tools, do you think it could be spliced back together?&quot; I asked.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;If I found you some tools, do you think it could be spliced back together?&quot; I asked.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;No need. I already found a toolkit. There was a makeshift campsite -- a few years old, I&#39;d say. Someone&#39;s been stuck on this planet before.&quot;

I reminded myself to make a note of that. &quot;Let us know if you need anything. We&#39;ll be able to tell from here whether you get it back online.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Darvok stayed at the security station and guided me to the communications array. We used our communicators to stay in touch. I told Darvok what I could see, and she relayed instructions to me on which way to turn.

The hallways described a number of concentric circles. In the center there was a hexagonal room with a domed skylight. Directly under the dome was a column of electronic equipment in the center of the room, and outside at the apex of the dome was a huge dish. Through the clear panes of the dome I could see the sky: swirling, angry orange clouds of lightning and dust. If this was the atmosphere, the world outside looked barely habitable.

Also, the power conduit to the communicatons array had been severed, possibly by a phaser. A blistered line of scarred metal floor, black with charcoal, cut through the power line.

&quot;The power has been cut,&quot; I reported to Darvok. &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;engineering&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Shut down the power if you can, and I can splice it back together.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I might be able to patch it.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I will disconnect the power to your area,&quot; Darvok said. &quot;Do you have tools?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; I looked around, and saw what appeared to be an indoor camping arrangement: a few bedrolls, some empty food containers, a powered lantern, and some tools. &quot;Wait, I think I found some. It looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe a few years ago. There&#39;s a lot of dust, and these tools are somewhat old.&quot;

&quot;We are not the first to find this world, then,&quot; Darvok noted over the communicator. &quot;The power should be off. Let me know when you have finished.&quot;

It was a pretty easy patch job, but I had to wonder about that little camping site. Who had stayed here, and why?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 1 and $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;When Pyria and Allaire checked in, I let them know about the communications array. With the help of the overhead facility map, we were able to show them how to reach the room where the communications hub was located. After some time, they were able to report back in on their findings.

&quot;It looks like it&#39;s been cut off from the power grid,&quot; Pyria reported. &quot;Someone cut the conduits at some point. I think they can be spliced. Shut down the power to that area and we&#39;ll go back and get right to work on it.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;engineering&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Do you need tools?&quot; I asked. &quot;I have mine here.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Do you need any tools?&quot; I asked. &quot;I could look around.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;No, we found a toolkit at the communications hub. Someone had evidently camped out in this facility before. We&#39;re not the first ones to be stranded here.&quot;

I reminded myself to make a note of that. &quot;Let us know if you need anything. We&#39;ll be able to tell from here whether you get it back online.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;When Pyria checked in, I let him know about the communications array.

I didn&#39;t need to ask what had to be done. Repairing the power conduits was our primary task, although we would have to cut the power first. I returned to the security station to check in.

&quot;The power has been cut,&quot; I reported to Darvok. &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;engineering&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Shut down the power if you can, and I can splice it back together.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I might be able to patch it.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I will disconnect the power to that area,&quot; Darvok said. &quot;Do you have tools?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;engineering&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Of course,&quot; I said. &quot;It should be an easy patch.&quot;

She tapped at the console. &quot;The power is now off. Let me know when you have finished.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I think I found some near the communications hub,&quot; I said. &quot;It looked like someone was sleeping here. Maybe a few years ago. There&#39;s a lot of dust, and the tools are somewhat old.&quot;

&quot;We are not the first to find this world, then,&quot; Darvok noted, tapping at the console. &quot;Very well. The power is now off. Let me know when you have finished.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Who had stayed here, and why?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 2&gt;&gt;I/we decided the best way to investigate the communications array was to do it myselves. I stayed at the security station with one body and went to the array with the other. I/we had to hold onto the station with both hands and lean on the walls, but I/we made it.

&quot;I made it,&quot; I/we told Darvok dizzily, gripping the console.

&quot;Are you able to see what the other body sees?&quot; she asked, incredulous.

&quot;Yes,&quot; I/we said, but I/we spoke with the wrong body. Darvok looked at one of me expectantly. &quot;Sorry,&quot; I/we said. &quot;Yes, it can be.&quot;

&quot;Do you require tools?&quot;

&quot;There is sign of previous ... habitation in the room,&quot; I/we said. The rooms were spinning as I/we tried to look around, and I/we grabbed the wall for support. Too many legs. &quot;A few bedrolls, a powered lantern. Some food containers. A toolbox. I can make do with these. Those.&quot;

&quot;Years,&quot; I/we said. &quot;There&#39;s a great deal of dust. Shut down the power, I&#39;m going to splice the power conduit.&quot;

This room looked promising.

Darvok directed me to the transporter array that she saw on the overhead map of the facility. I thought she was right: it had to be some kind of transporter station. There was a transporter pad, similar to many others I had seen before, and there was a computer station nearby that was presumably meant for controlling the matter transmissions. If the Procrustean transporter systems were designed to alter our physiology during transmission, &lt;span class=&quot;secret&quot;&gt;[[switching|P: Transporters][$randomize to 1 - $randomize]]&lt;/span&gt; around our digital patterns in its buffer somewhere, then perhaps there was a way to use this machine to reverse the process.

I sat down to study it, and I thought I came up with some pretty solid conclusions. There seemed to be a bar that one pulled back, rather like a short chrome-handed lever. I reckoned that was the transport activation. Beside that was a timer, so timed self-transport could be done. To the right of those were three major controls that I couldn&#39;t identify: a [[triangular pad|P: Function One][$pad to &quot;triangular&quot;]], a [[square pad|P: Function Two][$pad to &quot;square&quot;]], and a [[torus-shaped pad|P: Function Three][$pad to &quot;torus-shaped&quot;]]. &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;operations&quot;&gt;&gt;I was pretty sure these had something to do with the transporter operation, and would alter the pattern in the buffer somehow; I just wasn&#39;t sure how.&lt;&lt;elseif $dept == &quot;engineering&quot;&gt;&gt;The pads were wired through the transport buffer, so it seemed pretty clear this was how the physical transformations had been done.&lt;&lt;elseif $dept == &quot;science&quot;&gt;&gt;I thought I recognized some of the symbols near the pads, maybe distantly related to an ancient language we had covered in some class. These symbols might have said &quot;after,&quot; which meant you pushed these pads after beaming someone up.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I couldn&#39;t make anything of the three pads, but I didn&#39;t have anything to lose by trying them.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; When I tried pushing one, there was a little annoyed click from the console, and an error message flashed on a dusty screen: clearly it was waiting for transporter input before operating.

Without any further insight into the machine, I would simply have to try pushing one of the buttons randomly.

Maybe I should just keep these notes and try again later. It might be dangerous to play with this machine until we know exactly what it does. There&#39;s [[lots to do|P: Choices][$recent to &quot;skipped&quot;, $ach.push(&quot;skipped&quot;), $ach.push(&quot;device&quot;)]] before we can get out of here.

wait

This is the weirdest thing I&#39;ve ever felt. We&#39;ve ever felt. I/we am not just one person, I/we am &lt;&lt;if $dup == 2&gt;&gt;two.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 3&gt;&gt;three.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 4&gt;&gt;four.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 8&gt;&gt;eight.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 16&gt;&gt;sixteen.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 32&gt;&gt;thirty-two.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Trying to stand with all my/our legs is hard. Balance is hard. Getting better. I/we can see everything. Really good spatial awareness. I/we&#39;re &lt;&lt;if $dup == 2&gt;&gt;both&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;all&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; of these bodies at the same time. Duplicated.

This was a mistake. Still have lots to do. Gender still backwards. Made things worse. Not touching this machine again. Needs a lifetime of further study.

As soon as I/we can walk, I/we are going to keep [[working on my list|P: Choices]]. Explain everything to Darvok &lt;&lt;if $surv gt 2&gt;&gt;and the others &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;later.

&quot;I can&#39;t explain much myself,&quot; I said, and tried to fill him in on Darvok&#39;s deductions and assumptions.

&quot;Yes, it was Procrustes,&quot; Tamura said, confirming Darvok&#39;s guess. &quot;It came up as Contact Prohibited, but we didn&#39;t have much choice. Now I think I see why Starfleet didn&#39;t want any ships coming here. Have you found the technology they used to do this?&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; the Admiral said. &quot;In any case, our first priority is to contact Starfleet. Have you been able to contact the ship?&quot;

I shook my head. &quot;No, sir. &lt;&lt;if $ach.includes(&quot;commsat&quot;)&gt;&gt;We have restored communication, but we haven&#39;t been able to reach the //Beta Centauri//.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;We are still hoping to restore communication.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; There&#39;s a central hub in the complex, a large room with an interplanetary communication array.

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I thought the pirates had already gone. I was wrong.

When Darvok and I had escaped from our cell, we had run into a pirate. He was ugly and leering, and he smelled like a drunken ship&#39;s engineer: alcohol, lubricant, ozone, and sweat. &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;I still remember the way he leered at us in our female bodies.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I still remember the way he leered at Darvok in her new female body.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Now that I think about it, he hadn&#39;t been dressed as all the other transformed crew, in this universal black body suit. He still wore the battered, patched and unsightly rags that passed for his uniform. He hadn&#39;t been changed, and it hadn&#39;t occurred to me to wonder why not.

And he had been looking for someone. Lekos, my notes say. Who was Lekos? I don&#39;t know, but the pirate seemed to be looking for a woman. Looking for Lekos among the transformed female prisoners. Perhaps it was one of his own crew, previously a man, who had been accidentally caught in the Procrustean defense systems?

No matter: I just ran into another pirate from the crew. This one was happily, angrily drunk. I saw him storming into a cell, refugees scattering before him in the hall. I heard the voices of two women screaming inside the cell. I heard him demanding to know where Lekos was, if one of the women in the cell was he. He was armed. 

I could rush in and try to [[defend the women,|P: Defend Erelan]] &lt;&lt;if $ach.includes(&quot;weapons&quot;)&gt;&gt;because I was armed and they surely were not.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;even though I had no weapon.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Or I could try to [[ambush him|P: Ambush Pirate]] as he left their cell, although that might expose the women inside to greater danger.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we thought the pirates had already gone.

The pirate got off a single shot while he was headed for the floor, but it didn&#39;t hit any living targets. It merely splashed safely on the wall above the bunk, disintegrating a chunk of composite stonework. I don&#39;t approve of shooting someone in the back. It was cold-blooded -- but necessary.

The stench of roasted flesh was appalling, but the pirate was no longer a threat to anyone. It was cold-blooded -- and necessary.

The stench of roasted flesh was appalling. The pirate was no longer a threat to anyone. It was cold-blooded -- and necessary.

Maybe I wasn&#39;t big and strong any more. Maybe he was strong enough and big enough to pin both my tiny wrists in one of his huge fists. Still, I was far from helpless. I had just enough muscle to make the difference in the fight. &quot;You like it when your prisoners fight?&quot; I asked the pirate.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he said. &quot;Makes it way more fun.&quot;

&quot;Oh, good. Maybe you&#39;ll like this,&quot; I said, and kicked out his knee out sideways. His legs disappeared from under him and he went down, releasing my hands and Darvok&#39;s waist as he tried to brace for impact.

He tried to make it back to his feet, wobbling on the injured knee, but I had another kick ready. This one caught him on the forehead as he was rising unsteadily, and his head snapped back. He tumbled into the wall, and his disruptor slipped from his holster and clattered onto the ground.

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 1 and $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;Darvok dipped down quickly to retrieve the disruptor, but it was not necessary. Suddenly we were not alone in the corridor. Two figures, dressed in black neck-to-toe jumpsuits just as Darvok and I were, appeared out of nowhere and grabbed at the pirate&#39;s arms, pinning him to the wall of the corridor. One of the figures was a massive Klingon male with a craggy face and brown skin, and the other was an Bajoran male with a look of fury.

The pirate tried to go for his holster and found it empty. The Klingon closed one massive fist around his throat and raised him bodily off the ground, rhythmically bouncing the back of his skull against the wall. As the pirate scrabbled desperately for air with both hands, the Bajoran reeled off one heavy punch after another directly into the pirate&#39;s unprotected abdomen.

The pirate didn&#39;t withstand this punishment long, and after a moment it was clear no more punishment was required. The body was limp in the Klingon&#39;s grip, and the Klingon simply tossed him to one side where he crumpled into a heap. &quot;I could get used to this,&quot; he said to the Bajoran.

&quot;It&#39;ll take me a while,&quot; the Bajoran muttered, and turned to us. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;Darvok dipped down quickly to retrieve the disruptor, but it was not necessary. There was another figure in the corridor, a massive hulking Klingon male that seemed to blot out the light. Like me, he was dressed in a black neck-to-toe jumpsuit. A look of studied focus was on his craggy brown face, as he closed one massive fist around the pirate&#39;s throat and raised him bodily off the ground, rhythmically bouncing the back of his skull against the wall.

The pirate scrabbled desperately for air with both hands, but the repeated concussions and lack of air was soon too much for him. His eyes glazed, and his arms dropped limply to his sides. The Klingon tossed the man aside like a doll.

Then the Klingon turned to us, quickly assessing us for injuries. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;Darvok dipped down quickly to retrieve the disruptor, but it was not necessary. There was another figure in the corridor, a Bajoran male with a look of desperate fury. Like me, he was dressed in a black neck-to-toe jumpsuit. He lashed out with one foot at the pirate&#39;s midsection, knocking loose all his air. Then the Bajoran grabbed both the man&#39;s arms from behind and rode him to the ground. The pirate fell to the deck with the Bajoran on top of him. Without a hand to protect himself, he hit the floor face-first with a sickening crack of bone.

There was nothing left to do. The pirate was now unconscious, and would be for hours. All the fight had gone out of him.

The Bajoran stood up and turned to us, dusting himself off. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Darvok dipped quickly to retrieve the disruptor. Before the pirate had a chance to recover his breath or his wits, Darvok shot him in the belly. I don&#39;t think she even checked to see which setting the weapon was on.

The disruptor blew a smoking, charred hole in the pirate&#39;s chest. I&#39;m not going to forget the look on his face for a long, long time, but at least he was no longer a threat to us.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $surv gt 2&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes. Thank you for your assistance,&quot; Darvok said plainly. The terse, matter-of-fact tone had gone from her voice, to be replaced by weariness and anxiety. &quot;I presume you are also from the //Beta Centauri//?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[1] == 1 and $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; the Bajoran man answered. &quot;I&#39;m Cadet Zoya Allaire of Starfleet. This is Cadet Pyria Calinor.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; the Bajoran man answered. &quot;I&#39;m Cadet Zoya Allaire of Starfleet.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I am,&quot; the Klingon man replied. &quot;Cadet Pyria Calinor of Starfleet Academy. Call me Cadet Pyria. It&#39;s a ... a Bajoran thing.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I&#39;m really glad it&#39;s you,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;m $playername, and this is Darvok. You can probably guess that we&#39;re having just as strange a day as you are.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;Allaire, the Bajoran male, was running his medical scanner over us -- Starfleet issue, of course. &quot;That&#39;s an understatement,&quot; he said dryly. &quot;That&#39;s a new look for you, isn&#39;t it, $playername?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Pyria, the Klingon male, nodded curtly. &quot;Undoubtedly, yes. You two are as changed as I. Perhaps it is different with you, but I find it ... rather difficult so far.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;This is a strange place to find ourselves, for sure,&quot; I said, as I tried to look in both directions down the corridor. Beside me, Darvok checked her tricorder. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to figure out what to do next if we&#39;re going to get out of this place.&quot;

&quot;Get out?&quot; Darvok asked blankly. &quot;Get out? Surely we must find a way to reverse this, this ...&quot; She was starting to panic, and I wrapped my arms around her to calm her down. Her rapid breathing gradually slowed down. &quot;I apologize,&quot; she said in a tremulous whisper. &quot;This is ... difficult. Why are you not experiencing problems of adaptation as I am? Are you enjoying this?&quot;

I hadn&#39;t had time to stop and think about it. The experience was still so new and so unfamiliar that I hadn&#39;t had time to really assess what would happen if I were stuck this way for -- for a while, perhaps forever. Perhaps what had been done could not be undone?

In some ways, I could see how some men might [[love|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;love&quot;]] being a woman. It was so different, so liberating, to be free of the expectations of masculine roles. It could be a great [[opportunity|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;opportunity&quot;]] to see how the other half lived, and I could probably [[get used to it|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;adapt&quot;]] eventually. On the other hand, this new body was strange, and there were sure to be [[awkward|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;awkward&quot;]] times ahead, and the more I thought about it, it would be [[bizarre|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;bizarre&quot;]] to have to explain this to my family.

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;Darvok and I had no muscles, and only a single blade between us. The pirate had a disruptor.

Still, he had only two eyes, and there were two of us to occupy his attention. &quot;This planet makes pretty women,&quot; the pirate said, staring lasciviously at our curves in a way that was distinctly uncomfortable. &quot;Even though you did used to be men of some kind. Maybe even somebody important. A captain, maybe. A policeman. Hell, maybe an //admiral.//&quot; He gurgled a satisfied laugh to himself, and waved his gun at us, indicating we should exit the cell before him. &quot;Not any more, you&#39;re not. Now you&#39;re mine.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Darvok had no muscles in her new body, and I had the vibro-knife, so I knew it was up to me to do something. The man&#39;s eyes were on Darvok, capturing the whole of his attention. &quot;This planet makes pretty women,&quot; the pirate said, staring lasciviously at his curves in a way that was distinctly familiar. I was used to that kind of attention being focused on me. &quot;Even though you did used to be a man of some kind. Maybe even somebody important. A captain, maybe. A policeman. Hell, maybe an //admiral.//&quot; He gurgled a satisfied laugh to himself, and waved his gun at her, indicating she should exit the cell before him. &quot;Not any more, you&#39;re not. Now you&#39;re mine.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

For that moment when his attention was mostly on Darvok, I lashed out with the vibro-knife. It sawed through the pirate&#39;s forearm with ease, buzzing in my hand with the faint resistance provided by muscle and bone. The wrist and hand, gun included, sheared away, leaving behind a cauterized stump.

Oh, how he howled -- at least until I put the knife into his throat. That shut him up.

It was the most brutal thing I had had to do since entering the Academy, and I was sure I would remember it for years. When it was done and the pirate was collapsed on the floor of the cell, I was shaking with nervous energy, but Darvok and I were safe.

&quot;We can&#39;t stay in here,&quot; I urged Darvok. &quot;Grab his gun. Let&#39;s get out of this place.&quot;

As if she had been waiting for permission, she stood up from her bunk, demurely tugged the disruptor loose from the pirate&#39;s disembodied hand, and followed me into the corridor.

I led her into the hall. The alien construction was here, too: massive wedge-shaped hallways, wider at the top than the bottom, with some complex lighted grate overhead. The passageway arced in both directions, as if the hallway were part of a larger circle. Other doors, which I presumed were cells like ours, were dotted here and there along the walls. All were shut.

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 1 and $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;There were two figures further down the corridor, both males, both dressed in head-to-toe black jumpsuits as we were. One was a huge hulking Klingon with brown skin and a craggy forehead, and the other was a Bajoran male with an annoyed scowl on his face. They didn&#39;t seem to be pirates, so I waved to them.

They muttered something to each other, then joined us in the hall outside our cell. &quot;One of the pirates, eh?&quot; the Bajoran man said, after glancing into the cell and seeing the collapsed figure of the leering man I had just knocked out. &quot;Are you two okay?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;There was a figure further down the corridor, a male dressed in a head-to-toe black jumpsuit the same as we were. He was a huge hulking Klingon with brown skin and a craggy forehead. He didn&#39;t seem to be one of the pirates, so I waved to him.

He joined us in the hall outside our cell, glancing in and noticing the collapsed form of the leering pirate I had just knocked out. &quot;Nice work, the Klingon said. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;There was a figure further down the corridor, a male dressed in a head-to-toe black jumpsuit the same as we were. He was a Bajoran male with an annoyed scowl on his face. He didn&#39;t seem to be one of the pirates, so I waved to him.

He joined us in the hall outside our cell. &quot;One of the pirates, eh?&quot; the Bajoran man said, after glancing into the cell and seeing the collapsed figure of the leering man I had just knocked out. &quot;Are you two okay?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t see anyone else,&quot; I said, glancing in either direction.

&quot;It would still be well to keep your voice low,&quot; Darvok advised me. &quot;There may be others nearby.&quot;

I nodded, and prepared to head down the corridor, but she took my hand and stopped me. &quot;Yes?&quot; I asked, turning back to her.

Darvok&#39;s green Orion features were looking back at me, eyes large and liquid. &quot;$playername, I feel I should thank you for rescuing me. It is a strange thing to suddenly discover I am ... peculiarly vulnerable in this state.&quot; Her eyes dropped, ashamed, to her black-clad female figure. &quot;I have the training of a cadet and the memories of a Vulcan, but suddenly I have the instincts of an Orion female.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;This situation is new to me, too,&quot; I reminded her, taking her small shoulder in my unusually large hand. &quot;We&#39;ll get through it somehow.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;This situation is new to me, too,&quot; I reminded her, putting my petite little hand on her slender shoulder. &quot;We&#39;ll get through it somehow.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;We will,&quot; Darvok says, and shudders in relief. &quot;Thank you again for saving me.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $surv gt 2&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; Darvok said plainly. The terse, matter-of-fact tone had gone from her voice, to be replaced by weariness and anxiety. &quot;I presume you are also from the //Beta Centauri//?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[1] == 1 and $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; the Bajoran man answered. &quot;I&#39;m Cadet Zoya Allaire of Starfleet. This is Cadet Pyria Calinor.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; the Bajoran man answered. &quot;I&#39;m Cadet Zoya Allaire of Starfleet.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I am,&quot; the Klingon man replied. &quot;Cadet Pyria Calinor of Starfleet Academy. Call me Cadet Pyria. It&#39;s a ... a Bajoran thing.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I&#39;m really glad it&#39;s you,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;m $playername, and this is Darvok. You can probably guess that we&#39;re having just as strange a day as you are.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;Allaire, the Bajoran male, was running his medical scanner over us -- Starfleet issue, of course. &quot;That&#39;s an understatement,&quot; he said dryly. &quot;That&#39;s a new look for you, isn&#39;t it, $playername?&quot;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Pyria, the Klingon male, nodded curtly. &quot;Undoubtedly, yes. You two are as changed as I. Perhaps it is different with you, but I find it ... rather difficult so far.&quot;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&quot;This is a strange place to find ourselves, for sure,&quot; I said, as I tried to look in both directions down the corridor. Beside me, Darvok checked her tricorder. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to figure out what to do next if we&#39;re going to get out of this place.&quot;

&quot;Get out?&quot; Darvok asked blankly. &quot;Get out? Surely we must find a way to reverse this, this ...&quot; She was starting to panic, and I wrapped my arms around her to calm her down. Her rapid breathing gradually slowed down. &quot;I apologize,&quot; she said in a tremulous whisper. &quot;This is ... difficult. Why are you not experiencing problems of adaptation as I am? Are you enjoying this?&quot;

I hadn&#39;t had time to stop and think about it. The experience was still so new and so unfamiliar that I hadn&#39;t had time to really assess what would happen if I were stuck this way for -- for a while, perhaps forever. Perhaps what had been done could not be undone?

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;In some ways, I could see how women might [[love|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;love&quot;]] being a man, having the power and the independence; it could be a great [[opportunity|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;opportunity&quot;]] to see how the other half lived, and I could probably [[get used to it|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;adapt&quot;]] eventually. On the other hand, this new body was strange, and there were sure to be [[awkward|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;awkward&quot;]] times ahead, and the more I thought about it, it would be [[bizarre|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;bizarre&quot;]] to have to explain this to my family.

It was so different, so liberating, to be free of the expectations of masculine roles. It could be a great [[opportunity|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;opportunity&quot;]] to see how the other half lived, and I could probably [[get used to it|P: Respond][$reaction to &quot;adapt&quot;]] eventually.

We didn&#39;t get far.

As we were preparing to leave the security station, someone staggered into the room, a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Lumerian|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;lumerian&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; female. We didn&#39;t recognize the newcomer as one of the pirates, not at first, partly because she wasn&#39;t carrying any weapon, and mostly because she was wearing the same black one-piece body suit that all of the transformed prisoners wore. We assumed she was someone from the //Beta Centauri//, transformed like us.

&quot;How did you get out?&quot; she demanded of us. &quot;Are you the ones letting everybody go?&quot;

Darvok attempted to answer. &quot;We have released the passengers and crew,&quot; she said. &quot;They have all been told to meet at the--&quot;

The Lumerian female snarled at us, waving off Darvok&#39;s reply. &quot;Have they gone?&quot; she asked angrily. &quot;The Major, and the others? Have they //gone//?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;The pirates?&quot; I asked, surprised. &quot;I&#39;ve seen one or two--&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;The pirates?&quot; I/we asked, surprised. &quot;We&#39;ve seen one or two--&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;Where?&quot; she demanded. She held up something clenched in one of her fists, opening the fingers for us to see. &quot;You tell me where you saw them. They&#39;re not leaving me here like ... like //this//,&quot; she grated, gesturing at her body with her other hand, &quot;with this damn defective piece of trash. A Berellian could have built a better anti-porter.&quot; She cast it to one side, a small electronic device the size of a finger, and its black case shattered on impact with the synthetic stone flooring. &quot;Did they do this on purpose?&quot;

&quot;That was meant to protect you,&quot; Darvok said, understanding. &quot;To prevent you from being beamed down like the rest of us were. You are part of the crew who attacked our ship.&quot; She paused, and a faint smile came across her green features. &quot;You must be Lekos. We ran into some of your comrades. They were ... most eager to find you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll //bet// they were,&quot; the woman who used to be Lekos replied with a sneer, &quot;but I&#39;m not staying here like this. You tell me where they are, you green bitch.&quot;

&quot;I cannot,&quot; Cadet Darvok answered. &quot;I do not know. Also, Starfleet has been called, so it would be in your best interest--&quot;

The Lumerian woman named Lekos didn&#39;t bother to wait to hear what her best interests might indicate. She lurched foward into the room, intently focused on Darvok, her hands and fingers outstretched as if she intended to wring the Orion woman&#39;s neck.

She closed the distance quickly, and the two transformed women wrestled for supremacy by one of the consoles. Neither was armed, and neither woman possessed the strength that had previously been familiar to her. They struggled bitterly together, pulling hair, biting, pushing, and fighting with every gram of strength they had.

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $inv.includes(&quot;phaser&quot;)&gt;&gt;I had a phaser, but I didn&#39;t know if I dared [[shoot|P: Pirate Shoot]].

The //Leeds// didn&#39;t go into orbit around Procrustes. It didn&#39;t dare. Instead, Captain Kozlov ordered his crew to send in empty preprogrammed shuttles. The shuttles came down into transport range, beamed up survivors, and returned to the ship. They didn&#39;t risk getting within range of the Procrustean defense systems, as we had.

We took extensive tricorder readings of the Procrustean transporter-transformer system, and marked it precisely with a signal beacon that the //Leeds// sent down to us. Someone from Starfleet will be back to scan the device, or even beam the whole thing up if possible, for further study.

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I took Lekos&#39;s broken device with me.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we took Lekos&#39;s broken device with me/us.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Apparently the pirates had been using something to hide them from the Procrustean defenses. Lekos&#39;s didn&#39;t work, but perhaps enough of it remained intact that it might be studied further.

The debriefing is over, finally.

Vice-Admiral Mutema contacted the ship, and the video was routed to the ready room of the //Leeds// where Captain Kozlov, a female Vulcan science officer named T&#39;Heya, and a human physician named Dr Pacquet, sat in. &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I sat near the monitor and answered their questions.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup lt 16&gt;&gt;I/we sat near the monitor and answered their questions.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Some of me/us sat near the monitor to answer their questions, while the rest of me/us stayed in my/our cabins.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; The questions weren&#39;t easy, either.

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I explained the events of the pirate attack as well as I could, consulting my log.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we explained the events of the pirate attack as well as I/we could, consulting my/our log.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; The Vice-Admiral interrupted frequently.

&quot;You had Captain Drugh&#39;s permission to use deadly force in defense of the ship?&quot; the Vice-Admiral demanded at one point.

Another time, she asked, &quot;And when the //Beta Centauri// was being taken into orbit around Procrustes, was it ever mentioned that contact with that planet is prohibited?&quot;

&quot;Vice-Admiral, the cadets were not among the crew of the vessel,&quot; T&#39;Heya observed. &quot;They bear no responsibility for its course heading.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Commander, but they beamed to the surface,&quot; the Vice-Admiral said. She turned back to &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me. &quot;Was this mentioned by Captain Drugh?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;Darvok guessed at the name of the planet, and we did observe that contact was prohibited, but we were beamed off the //Beta Centauri// against our will.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us. &quot;Was this mentioned by Captain Drugh?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; I/we said. &quot;Darvok guessed at the name of the planet, and we did observe that contact was prohibited, but we were beamed off the //Beta Centauri// against our will.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;By the Procrusteans?&quot; Vice-Admiral Mutema grunted suspiciously. &quot;Captain, did your crew find life signs on that planet?&quot;

&quot;None.&quot;

&quot;But you were not in orbit yourselves. Can you be sure of your sensor readings at that distance?&quot;

&quot;We sent a probe,&quot; Captain Kozlov said. &quot;And our shuttles were close enough to conduct limited scans. There were no life signs other than what we presume were prisoners. When we left, there were none in the area.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $surv == 0&gt;&gt;The Vice-Admiral looked at something on a screen. &quot;There are a number of cadet casualties. Three missing and presumed dead, one confirmed: Cadets Erelan, Darvok, Calinor, and Allaire. Dr Pacquet, is this correct?&quot;
&lt;&lt;elseif $surv == 1&gt;&gt;The Vice-Admiral looked at something on a screen. &quot;There are a number of cadet casualties. &lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 1&gt;&gt;Two missing and presumed dead, one confirmed: Cadets Erelan, Allaire and Darvok.&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 1&gt;&gt;Two missing and presumed dead, one confirmed: Cadets Erelan, Calinor, and Darvok.&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[2] == 1&gt;&gt;Two missing and presumed dead, one confirmed: Cadets Allaire, Calinor, and Darvok.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Three missing and presumed dead: Cadets Allaire, Calinor, and Erelan.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Dr Pacquet, is this correct?&quot;
&lt;&lt;elseif $surv == 4&gt;&gt;The Vice-Admiral looked at something on a screen. &quot;There were a number of Starfleet cadets on board. Five, by my count: Cadets Allaire, $playername, Calinor, Erelan, and Darvok. Dr Pacquet, is this correct?&quot;
&lt;&lt;elseif $surv == 3&gt;&gt;The Vice-Admiral looked at something on a screen. &quot;There was a casualty, a Starfleet cadet named &lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 0&gt;&gt;Calinor, missing and presumed dead.&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 0&gt;&gt;Allaire, missing and presumed dead.&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[2] == 0&gt;&gt;Erelan, mising and presumed dead.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Darvok, a Vulcan student who was returning to the Academy.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Dr Pacquet, is this correct?&quot;
&lt;&lt;elseif $surv == 2&gt;&gt;The Vice-Admiral looked at something on a screen. &quot;There were two cadet casualties. &lt;&lt;if $survivors[0] == 0 and $survivors[1] == 0&gt;&gt;Cadets Calinor and Allaire, missing and presumed dead.&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 0 and $survivors[2] == 0&gt;&gt;Cadets Calinor and Erelan, missing and presumed dead.&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[0] == 0 and $survivors[3] == 0&gt;&gt;Cadet Calinor, missing and presumed dead, and Cadet Darvok.&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 0 and $survivors[2] == 0&gt;&gt;Cadets Allaire and Erelan, missing and presumed dead.&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[1] == 0 and $survivors[3] == 0&gt;&gt;Cadet Allaire, missing and presumed dead, and Cadet Darvok.&lt;&lt;elseif $survivors[2] == 0 and $survivors[3] == 0&gt;&gt;Cadet Erelan, missing and presumed dead, and Cadet Darvok.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Dr Pacquet, is this correct?&quot;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&quot;We believe so, yes sir,&quot; the physician answered. &quot;Given the transformations involved and the number of passengers and crew to sort through, identification of the survivors has been slow.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Mutema said, sounding anything but understanding. &quot;Can you give an estimate for the total loss of life?&quot;

&quot;Until we recover the //Beta Centauri//,&quot; Captain Kozlov said, &quot;we&#39;re just speculating. There may be additional casualties on board the ship that never made it to the surface.&quot;

&quot;How many //missing//,&quot; the Vice-Admiral clarified.

&quot;Sixty passengers and crew,&quot; Dr Pacquet said.

The Vice-Admiral reviewed her screen again. &quot;There was an Orion diplomat on board, First Secretary Kayus Allendo. I understand you had some contact with him, Cadet $playername?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $hoto != &quot;living&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I said. &quot;I was able to save him from one of the pirates who attacked him in the crew lounge, a Major Hoto. I kept a record of the event in my personal log.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I/we said. &quot;We were able to save him from one of the pirates who attacked him in the crew lounge, a Major Hoto. We kept a record of the event in our personal log.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you kept a record. I&#39;m sure Starfleet would like to review the relevant entries from your log. What happened to this Major Hoto?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $hoto == &quot;killed&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I had to shoot him, sir,&quot; I said.&lt;&lt;elseif $hoto == &quot;escaped&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;He transported back to his ship, sir,&quot; I said.&lt;&lt;elseif $hoto == &quot;sedated&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I sedated him, sir,&quot; I said. &quot;The last I saw him, he was sleeping in the crew lounge.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $hoto == &quot;lured away&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;He transported back to his ship, sir,&quot; I said. &quot;It was a ruse to get him away from the First Secretary.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $hoto == &quot;stunned&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I stunned him, sir,&quot; I said. &quot;The last I saw him, he was lying between some tables in the crew lounge.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $hoto == &quot;killed&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;We had to shoot him, sir,&quot; I/we said.&lt;&lt;elseif $hoto == &quot;escaped&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;He transported back to his ship, sir,&quot; I/we said.&lt;&lt;elseif $hoto == &quot;sedated&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;We sedated him, sir,&quot; I/we said. &quot;The last we saw him, he was sleeping in the crew lounge.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $hoto == &quot;lured away&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;He transported back to his ship, sir,&quot; I/we said. &quot;It was a ruse to get him away from the First Secretary.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $hoto == &quot;stunned&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;We stunned him, sir,&quot; I/we said. &quot;The last we saw him, he was lying between some tables in the crew lounge.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Only briefly, in the infirmary. He was speaking to Cadet Allaire. We passed in the corridor.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;We&#39;ll need to speak more about that when you get back to the Academy,&quot; she said. &quot;The government of Orion is asking for your assistance with some of the details connected with that. Cadet, were you aware there was a political prisoner on board the //Beta Centauri//? Did you have any contact with him, either on the ship, or on the planet?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I was aware of him, sir, but I never saw him,&quot; I replied.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We were aware of him, sir, but we never saw him,&quot; I/we replied.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;Cadet Pyria was guarding him.&quot;

&quot;Pyria?&quot; she asked, consulting her records. &quot;Ah, yes, Cadet Calinor. Cadet Pyria, you say? Is that ... a &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Bajoran|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;bajoran&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; name?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir. We shared a cabin, sir.&quot;

Vice-Admiral&#39;s face softened slightly. &quot;And ... you intend to return to the Academy ... as you are?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;love&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t mind at all, sir,&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to try being &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;a man.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;a woman.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;I never thought I&#39;d get the chance to try it.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;The $race part, well ...

&quot;I see. Well, that I understand,&quot; the Vice-Admiral said distantly. &quot;I shall inform the Academy.

Do we admit this cadet back in as a single officer candidate? Or more than one?&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;Make sure they&#39;re healthy and normal. We have to know what this alien machine did to our people.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Try to verify whether these ... changes in race are in some way detectable, or somehow distinguishable from a normal $race. If this machine could manufacture the perfect intelligence agent, we have to know before it&#39;s used against us.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Also, see if there could have been some kind of ... mental manipulation. Some kind of indoctrination. Remember what happened when the Borg came.&quot;

The Vice-Admiral disconnected shortly after that.

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I had my physical this morning.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we had a physical this morning.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Dr Pacquet of the USS //Leeds// seemed ... impressed. And a little worried.

&quot;As far as I can tell, you&#39;re a perfectly ordinary $race $newgender,&quot; he confessed, looking over his medical data while &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;one of me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; sat on the exam bed. &quot;If this technology is what they say it is, then frankly, I&#39;m stumped. It would be a lot easier with today&#39;s technology to ... I don&#39;t know, clone a body illegally and imprint someone&#39;s synaptic patterns into it. Even that would be pretty far-fetched.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;The female science officer, T&#39;Heya, was present for the exam. &quot;Is there no way to discern this transformation?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;The captain, Kozlov, was present, probably because he was male. &quot;There&#39;s no way at all to tell the difference between a transformed human and a natural-born one?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Dr Pacquet held his hands up, as if trying to shape a cloud of ignorance floating in front of him. &quot;I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s //impossible// to tell. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;Human DNA has a lot of redundant and unused encoding.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$race DNA, like human DNA, has a lot of redundant and unused coding.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Maybe there are certain ... patterns that have been inserted into unused sections of protein chains, some non-expressed alleles that have been ... I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s certainly not anything obvious, or at least not to me.&quot;

He reviewed the chart again. &quot;No sign of mental tampering,&quot; he observed. &quot;At least on the gross physical level. Cadet $playername&#39;s brain structure is comparable to the brain structure in the transmission logs the last time &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;he&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;she&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; stepped into a transporter.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;A sensible comparison,&quot; T&#39;Heya nodded. &quot;What is your assessment? Is she fit to return to the Academy in her present state?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Huh,&quot; the captain grunted. &quot;And you think it&#39;s safe to send him back to the Academy like this?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I can&#39;t think of a reason not to, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking,&quot; Dr Pacquet told them.

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Then let&#39;s send him back,&quot; Captain Kozlov said with decision. &quot;Write up a report with your medical conclusions and I&#39;ll sign off on it.&quot; After that, he left us alone in the infirmary.&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Then we must do so. Present your findings to the captain in writing. I will return to the bridge,&quot; the science officer said, and left us alone in the infirmary.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Then let&#39;s get T&#39;Heya up here and run some tests on these multiple bodies of his,&quot; Captain Kozlov said, and started heading out of the infirmary. &quot;Let&#39;s see what he can do with them.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I would like to conduct some experiments later on her ability to use her multiple bodies,&quot; Lt Cmdr T&#39;Heya said, departing the infirmary. &quot;It is most unusual to find a true, organic gestalt entity. Cadet $playername, let me know when you are available.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Oh, good: more tests.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;There&#39;s one more thing,&quot; Dr Pacquet said, when we were alone. &quot;This ... molecular and physical reorganization that you&#39;ve undergone may have had some side effects on your sexuality. We don&#39;t know how much the Procrusteans knew about sexual expression, and we know they didn&#39;t exist recently enough to study modern $race physiology. That means it&#39;s possible their device changed the way you feel about sex ... but it&#39;s also possible that it didn&#39;t change it at all.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I nodded to show I understood.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we nodded to show I/we understood.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Dr Pacquet continued. &quot;What I&#39;m saying is this,&quot; he said. &quot;If you do feel your attraction has changed, then nobody would blame you for that happening, given all that you&#39;ve been through. And even if it didn&#39;t, then you have to allow that other people might not feel the same way about you that they did before, for better or for worse. There could well be some difficulties ahead of you.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about that a lot,&quot; I said, &quot;but&#39;s just until we can find a way to change everyone back.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ve been thinking about that a lot,&quot; I/we said, &quot;but&#39;s just until we can find a way to change everyone back.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

He hesitated. &quot;If that is even possible,&quot; the doctor said, speaking haltingly, as if finding it difficult to pick his words. &quot;We don&#39;t know yet whether it //is// possible to change anyone &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;back, much less to recombine you back into one body.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;back.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; He took a deep breath, putting one hand on my arm. &quot;You may have to prepare yourself for the worst.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;That gave me a lot to think about after my medical exam, and now I&#39;m sitting here logging everything I can remember about the meeting I just had. Of course, I/we took copious notes on my/our PADD while it was happening, which was convenient. But the question remains: who am I now? Have I changed? Do I still think the way I used to think?

T&#39;Heya, the science officer, put me/us through my/our paces today. I/we&#39;re not sure what it all means yet.

She had me/us sit in different parts of the ship. One of me/us would be presented with information, something simple like a colored circle on a screen, and &lt;&lt;if $dup == 2&gt;&gt;both&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 3&gt;&gt;all three&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;all&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; of me/us at my/our stations would each press a button to indicate the answer.

There was no discernable difference in timing. The me sitting with the screen had the same reaction times as the me who was not. It was as if I/we were seeing everything with one mind simultaneously &lt;&lt;if $dup == 2&gt;&gt;with both of my bodies.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 3&gt;&gt;with all three of my bodies.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 4&gt;&gt;with all four of my bodies.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 5&gt;&gt;with all five of my bodies.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;with all of my bodies.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

She tried increasing the inputs. &lt;&lt;if $dup == 2&gt;&gt;One of my/our bodies would read a passage on, say, agricultural techniques, and the other would listen to a piece of music.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 3&gt;&gt;One of my/our bodies would read a passage on, say, agricultural techniques, another would be given a math equation, and the other would listen to a piece of music.&lt;&lt;elseif $dup == 4&gt;&gt;One of my/our bodies would read a passage on, say, agricultural techniques, another would be given a math equation, another a puzzle to assemble, and the last body would listen to a piece of music.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;All my bodies would be given different tasks: a written passage on agricultural techniques, a puzzle, a math equation, a piece of music, a physical exercise, a painting ... various kinds of things.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I/we could do them both at once, and often faster than a single person could do them alone. With no lag time.

Lt Cmdr T&#39;Heya gave me/us cooperative tasks, also. These varied from physical tasks, such as climbing a barrier or lifting a large awkward object, to mental tasks such as a system of related math equations or a multi-part logic puzzle, to a combination of physical and mental: decoding a set of instructions to build an object. I/we could do them all, easily. I/we even seemed to get better with practice.

It didn&#39;t seem to matter how far apart my/our bodies were. Force fields didn&#39;t hamper me/us. Communications jamming didn&#39;t inhibit my/our thoughts.

T&#39;Heya seemed perplexed, for a Vulcan. &quot;Perhaps there is another way to approach this. Is there anything that you find difficult?&quot; 

I/we shook my/our heads. &quot;It was difficult at first,&quot; I/we said. &quot;It&#39;s getting a lot easier as we get practice.&quot;

She raised an eyebrow. &quot;Then my preliminary assessment is that you are capable of resuming your studies at the Academy: more studies, it seems, than the average individual student could pursue. Whatever limitations you have will be discovered with further experimentation, which is clearly needed.&quot;

Jori is single-minded in proving himself worthy of the position he&#39;s earned at the Academy, because the pressure of being the first in the family is a heavy burden to bear.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $dialogue == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;Jori was outside the dorm lobby when I arrived. He was leaning against the outer wall of the atrium, that naturally-lit little glass enclosure with the comfortable orange chairs that we always used to sit in to study. I went right up to him and introduced myself.

&quot;You&#39;re a man,&quot; he said, awestruck. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re a man. I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Orion&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re an Orion man. I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re a $race man. I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Neither can I,&quot; I said. &quot;And technically, I&#39;m $playerfirst ... and $oldfirst. I&#39;m a human, but transformed into a Trill, then implanted in $oldfirst&#39;s body. We&#39;re both here with you, actually. The past few days have been more than a little strange for both of us.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Neither can I,&quot; I said. &quot;The last few days have been a little strange, to be honest with you.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I&#39;ll bet!&quot; he said, with feeling. He had a look of curiosity mixed with embarrassment as he looked me up and down, examining my new man&#39;s body. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s two of you in there. And the Academy is letting you come back to study while they work this all out?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t believe that&#39;s you in there. And the Academy is letting you come back to study while they work all this out?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

I nodded. &quot;There&#39;s no way to know whether this can be undone,&quot; I said, &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;but if they can make it happen, they&#39;ll let me know. Us know. And in the meantime, I was retired from Starfleet, and $oldfirst was just starting -- there was no reason to throw away $oldfirst&#39;s education.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;but if they can make it happen, they&#39;ll let me know.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;You&#39;re a man,&quot; he said, awestruck. &quot;Wait, correct that. You&#39;re men. I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;

&quot;Neither can we,&quot; I.we said. &quot;The last few days have been a little strange, to be honest with you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll bet!&quot; he said, with feeling. He had a look of curiosity mixed with embarrassment as he looked me/us up and down, examining my new male bodies. &quot;I can&#39;t believe that&#39;s you in there. And the Academy is letting you come back to study while they work all this out?&quot;

I/we nodded. &quot;There&#39;s no way to know whether this can be undone,&quot; I/we said, &quot;but if they can make it happen, they&#39;ll let us know.&quot;

That life, Silunaa says, would have lacked grace, elegance, morals, and tranquility: always on the run, always looking for the next mark, measuring one&#39;s worth through sex and profits.

I sat down beside her. &quot;Hi,&quot; I said, embarrassed. &quot;It&#39;s me.&quot;

She unfolded those &lt;&lt;if $likesgirls == 1&gt;&gt;long, sexy legs&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;long, green legs&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and leaned forward, her eyes widening. She leaned right in close to get a good look at my &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;new female&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;new female $race&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; features. &quot;$playerfirst?&quot; she asked, astonished. &quot;This is ...

&quot;Crazy?&quot; I asked, supplying a few of the emotions I&#39;d been analyzing the past few days. &quot;Unbelieveable? Impossible? Amazing? Unfortunate?&quot;

&quot;All of them,&quot; she breathed, peering closely at my face. &quot;The only word that comes close is //gisjacheh//, but it ... doesn&#39;t really translate.&quot; She drew back from my face, taking in my figure: my female body, &lt;&lt;if $race != &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;my $race features, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $inv.includes(&quot;skirt uniform&quot;)&gt;&gt;my short skirt and bare legs, &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my female-cut uniform, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $boobs gt 8&gt;&gt;my impossibly large breasts, &lt;&lt;elseif $boobs gt 4&gt;&gt;my large rounded breasts, &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my modestly sized breasts, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Bolian&quot;&gt;&gt;my blue-tinted skin, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Bajoran&quot;&gt;&gt;my crinkled nose, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Trill&quot; or $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;my speckled temples, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Vulcan&quot; or $race == &quot;Romulan&quot;&gt;&gt;my arched brows and pointed ears, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Cardassian&quot; or $race == &quot;Klingon&quot;&gt;&gt;my bone-crested forehead, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Ferengi&quot;&gt;&gt;my large protruding ears, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Orion&quot;&gt;&gt;my green skin, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;and my general demeanor of &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;love&quot; or $reaction == &quot;opportunity&quot;&gt;&gt;awkwardness and unfamiliarity with my new body.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;adapt&quot; or $reaction == &quot;awkward&quot;&gt;&gt;awkwardness and discomfort with my new body.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;hate&quot; or $reaction == &quot;bizarre&quot;&gt;&gt;confusion and alienation with my new body.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; she said, and added, &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Orion&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;And you&#39;re even Orion like me, damn you.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Damn you.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;What?&quot; I asked. &quot;Damn me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m joking.

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask for this,&quot; I protested.

&quot;But you&#39;re going to stay here like this, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Silunaa asked, and sighed. &quot;Of course you are. I would. Being a Starfleet cadet is an opportunity that nobody should pass up.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $likesgirls == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not trying to compete with you,&quot; I said. &quot;I still like girls.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter who //you// like, it&#39;s who likes //you//,&quot; Silunaa said. &quot;Now you&#39;re going to get all the attention.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I just got turned into this by accident,&quot; I said. &quot;I mean, I think I might like boys, but it&#39;s not like I&#39;m trying to compete with you for any of them.&quot;

&quot;But they&#39;ll compete for //you//,&quot; Silunaa said. &quot;You&#39;re going to get all the attention.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;You&#39;re still beautiful and brilliant,&quot; I assured her. &quot;You won&#39;t have any trouble standing out, believe me.&quot;

She smiled at me. &quot;That&#39;s kind of you. I don&#39;t know why this bothers me so much, anyway. I left the Orion Syndicate because it was all about sex. Sexual politics, angling for the best mates, manipulating others. I didn&#39;t think this would make me so jealous, but I guess it does.&quot;

&quot;So, do you think we should [[still be roommates,|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;try&quot;]] or should we [[not live together|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;move out&quot;]] this term?&quot; I asked her. &quot;We can still be friends, and if our relationship is strong, it can withstand this too.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Silunaa was waiting in the atrium just off the dorm lobby when I/we arrived.

//Of course,// she said, a look of bemused impatience crossing her face. //Come on, tell me everything. It&#39;s faster this way.//

//And I can&#39;t lie,// I thought, before I could stop myself.

&quot;But things have changed,&quot; Jirra said. &quot;We can pretend they haven&#39;t, but it won&#39;t be easy to keep seeing each other. We&#39;re not the same couple that we were.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; I said. &quot;But I would still [[like to try.|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;try&quot;]] I hope we can.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;The thing is,&quot; I told her hesitantly, &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think $oldfirst and I are&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; into girls any more.

&quot;I was afraid of that,&quot; Jirra said, pursing her lips. &quot;Is there anything anybody can do?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I admitted. &quot;Not right now, anyway. Maybe someday. I know it&#39;s awkward right now, but I still want to pursue our relationship.&quot;

&quot;What does this mean for Starfleet?&quot; she asked. &quot;For the Academy?&quot; A moment of hesitation, then, &quot;For us?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $likesgirls == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;We still like girls,&quot; I/we told her. &quot;We know this is very different for you, but ... for us, that has not changed.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We like boys now,&quot; I/we told her. &quot;I know this isn&#39;t easy, but we can still be together.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;But things have changed,&quot; Jirra said. &quot;We can pretend they haven&#39;t, but it won&#39;t be easy to keep seeing each other. We&#39;re not the same couple that we were. We&#39;re not even a couple any more.&quot;

&quot;We know,&quot; I/we said. &quot;But we would still like to try. We hope we can.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s too many of you,&quot; she objected. &quot;I don&#39;t want to give up either. You have a lot to deal with, and I can&#39;t imagine not being there for you. This will be difficult enough for you as it is. Let&#39;s see that you get &lt;&lt;if $dup == 2&gt;&gt;a room&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;some rooms&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; [[of your own.|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;move out&quot;]] It doesn&#39;t make sense to split you up like that.

She&#39;s determined, fair-minded, and doesn&#39;t believe in holding back: not the truth, not herself, nor anyone else. She&#39;s struggled a little with the political nature of executive operations and personnel management, as she tends to favor unhappy honesty over politeness and tact, but she&#39;s learning.

&lt;&lt;if $dialogue == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;Kristjiana was talking with some of the other students in the dorm when I arrived. She talking with them about some event listed on the public calendar in the lobby. When she saw me, at first she didn&#39;t know I was $playerfirst. She said, &quot;Hi! I just wanted to make everybody aware that there&#39;s a Women In Command seminar coming up on Stardate 48458,&quot; and pointed at the calendar on a large wall monitor. &quot;Are you pursuing a command specialty, and can we count on your support at the meeting?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $majors.includes(&quot;Executive Operations&quot;) or $majors.includes(&quot;Flight Control&quot;) or $majors.includes(&quot;Ground Control&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I am in the command department,&quot; I said, &quot;but I came here to talk to you about something.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not in command,&quot; I admitted. &quot;Actually, I came here to talk to you about something.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;Oh?&quot; she asked curiously. &quot;Let&#39;s step away from the monitor. It&#39;s a bit crowded. Everybody&#39;s figuring out their schedules.&quot; I followed her to a small cluster of comfortable orange chairs in an atrium full of greenery. It had been one of our favorite places to study, last year. &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Kristi, it&#39;s me,&quot; I said forlornly. &quot;It&#39;s Cadet &lt;&lt;if $race != &quot;Trill host&quot; and $race != &quot;Trill&quot;&gt;&gt;$oldname.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$playername. Actually, it&#39;s $playerfirst $playername now, for the past couple of days.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

She opened her mouth to reply, and then her eyes and ears registered everything all at once: my female body, &lt;&lt;if $race != &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;my $race features, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $inv.includes(&quot;skirt uniform&quot;)&gt;&gt;my short skirt and bare legs, &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my female-cut uniform, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $boobs gt 8&gt;&gt;my impossibly large breasts, &lt;&lt;elseif $boobs gt 4&gt;&gt;my large rounded breasts, &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my modestly sized breasts, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Bolian&quot;&gt;&gt;my blue-tinted skin, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Bajoran&quot;&gt;&gt;my crinkled nose, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Trill&quot; or $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;my speckled temples, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Vulcan&quot; or $race == &quot;Romulan&quot;&gt;&gt;my arched brows and pointed ears, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Cardassian&quot; or $race == &quot;Klingon&quot;&gt;&gt;my bone-crested forehead, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Ferengi&quot;&gt;&gt;my large protruding ears, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Orion&quot;&gt;&gt;my green skin, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;and my general demeanor of &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;love&quot; or $reaction == &quot;opportunity&quot;&gt;&gt;awkwardness and unfamiliarity with my new body.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;adapt&quot; or $reaction == &quot;awkward&quot;&gt;&gt;awkwardness and discomfort with my new body.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;hate&quot; or $reaction == &quot;bizarre&quot;&gt;&gt;confusion and alienation with my new body.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she said. &quot;$playerfirst?

I filled her in on all the details I had left out of my message I had sent from the //Leeds.// There had been a lot I couldn&#39;t say, because Starfleet hadn&#39;t decided at that time whether to allow open communiques on the matter of Procrustes. Kristjiana listened with an open mouth, sitting close to me, sometimes touching my knee with her hand in feminine camaraderie before withdrawing her touch as if the contact had burned her fingers. Clearly, she didn&#39;t know how to react to this, which wasn&#39;t surprising, as neither did I.

&quot;So now what?&quot; she asked, when I had finished. Kristjiana was always very brisk and decisive. &quot;You&#39;re cleared to return to the Academy like nothing happened?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;And we have to decide whether we&#39;re going to continue sharing a dorm room.&quot;

&quot;You mean for this term?&quot; she asked, trying to read my new face. &quot;Or do you mean ... forever? Do they even know if this can be undone?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re working on it,&quot; I said wearily. &quot;Let&#39;s just take it one term at a time.&quot;

She nodded. &quot;All right, that&#39;s fair. I&#39;ll be honest, &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot; or $race == &quot;Trill&quot;&gt;&gt;$oldname ... er, $playername, I mean,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$oldname,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think I can date you ... like this. We can be friends, or at least I&#39;d like to try, but every time I look at you, I&#39;m not going to see my boyfriend. I&#39;m going to see the girl who stole him away. I realize that&#39;s not fair, and it&#39;s something I&#39;m going to have to deal with on my own. I just don&#39;t want there to be any illusions about how difficult this might be.&quot;

Straightforward, as always. That made me decide to be equally forthcoming. &lt;&lt;if $likesgirls == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;$oldfirst and I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; still like girls,&quot; I admitted. &quot;Whatever else the alien machine changed about me, it didn&#39;t change that.

&quot;I&#39;ll say,&quot; Kristjiana said. &quot;It&#39;s probably for the best that we tell the quartermaster to [[find different rooms|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;move out&quot;]] for us, all things considered. At least for this term.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Kristjiana was talking with some of the other students in the dorm when I/we arrived.

She glanced me over without recognizing me at first, turning away dismissively. I was a man now; &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;even if she&#39;d met me before, she wouldn&#39;t know me at this; and she wasn&#39;t interested in men, at any rate.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;of course she wouldn&#39;t know me, and men didn&#39;t interest her, even $race men.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I had to introduce myself.

&quot;That&#39;s impossible,&quot; she said flatly, when I told her who I was. &quot;No technology can do that.&quot;

&quot;It is possible,&quot; I said. &quot;I told you in my message. It happened to me.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I said, and started explaining from the beginning: the pirates, the //Beta Centauri//, the strange alien &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;world, the operation to combine the symbiont with the host.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;world.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; She listened, growing more and more withdrawn and unhappy the longer I spoke.

&quot;Your male voice is not pleasant,&quot; she said abruptly. &quot;When will they take you back to the planet to restore you back to normal?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know that either,&quot; I said. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I love this transformation, personally. It&#39;s fantastic.

&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; I/we said, and started explaining from the beginning: the pirates, the //Beta Centauri//, the strange alien world. She listened, growing more and more withdrawn and unhappy the longer I/we spoke.

&quot;Your male voices are not pleasant,&quot; she said abruptly. &quot;And you must learn to speak with just one, so I don&#39;t break my neck looking back and forth. When will they take you back to the planet to restore you back to normal?&quot;

&quot;You recognized me?&quot; I asked, surprised. I looked like a big $race male, I didn&#39;t see how that was possible.

&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I know how this goes, $oldfirst.

&quot;It&#39;s sure unusual,&quot; I grumbled.&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill&quot; or $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt; &quot;And yes, the name should be $playerfirst $playername now.&quot;

&quot;In the Trill fashion,&quot; she said approvingly.

I nodded.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;It is unusual for me too, at least a little,&quot; Sauzin told me. &quot;Trill don&#39;t ... reassociate. When two symbionts are lovers in one set of bodies, when we rejoin with another host, we don&#39;t go back to the same relationships. We always want to seek out new ones. It keeps Trill society from becoming ... aristocratic. Stale.&quot; She beamed at me. &quot;This is the first time one of my lovers has got a new body, and I get to stay together with &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;him.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;her.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Man or woman, it&#39;s all the same to me. That is,&quot; she added, &quot;if you are still willing.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $likesgirls == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I am,&quot; I said. &quot;My body was changed, but I still like women.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Sauzin said. &quot;Let&#39;s [[keep the same room,|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;try&quot;]] then. There&#39;s no reason to make any big changes just yet.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know if we should,&quot; I confessed. &quot;I don&#39;t think this body likes women.&quot;

Sauzin nodded understandingly. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;It can happen with Trill, too, as I&#39;m sure you know,&quot; she said.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;It can happen with Trill, too,&quot; she reassured me.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;Sexual orientation is usually stronger in the host body than it is in the symbiont. As far as our culture goes, I&#39;m used to the idea of not reassociating, but I can understand if it would be hard on you to part suddenly. Believe me, I&#39;m used to it. The only difference is, with you and I it isn&#39;t necessarily permanent. There might be a way back for you eventually.&quot;

&quot;And until then?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Let&#39;s keep our relationship as it is. Some day, it might be possible to reverse what was done to you.

&quot;That&#39;s an understatement,&quot; I/we grumbled.

&quot;It is unusual for me too, of course, apart from the duplication,&quot; Sauzin told me/us. &quot;Trill don&#39;t ... reassociate.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s you,&quot; I said, recognizing her as she passed me in the automatic doors. &quot;I was looking for you.&quot;

&quot;Indeed?&quot; she asked. &quot;You must be Cadet $oldname, then, as I know of nobody else who would be seeking me here.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go sit down,&quot; I said, suddenly acutely aware of &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;my big new male body.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my small new female body.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I led her to some comfortable orange chairs in the leafy green atrium, and sat down in one. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot; or $race == &quot;Trill&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s $playerfirst $playername now, by the way.

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; I said wryly.

&quot;No, it&#39;s an Earth expression,&quot; I said. &quot;It means ... well, it&#39;s hard to explain what it means.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it: an ironic indication that the speaker is familiar with the contextually relevant proposition,&quot; she said, after a moment&#39;s thought. &quot;So you were indicating familiarity?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, and laughed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. We haven&#39;t spoken in some time. I&#39;m not using to adjusting my idioms.&quot;

&quot;Nor am I accustomed to hearing them,&quot; she confessed. &quot;Returning to the Academy to be among so many of your kind is ... a difficult transition.&quot;

&quot;As is this,&quot; I said, gesturing at myself. &quot;I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to get through the next term like this.&quot;

T&#39;Khara raised an eyebrow. &quot;This transformation will be reversed at the end of the term?&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; I said. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do until then.&quot;

&quot;There is no reason we cannot [[continue to cohabit|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;try&quot;]] and maintain our relationship as it is until we learn whether your condition is permanent,&quot; she said. &quot;I am amenable to the proposition if you are.

&quot;You mean //pon farr//,&quot; I said.

&quot;Well remembered,&quot; she said to me. &quot;Our seven-year cycles are not always precise, but it is likely that I shall not experience //pon farr// during the course of the term.

&quot;Yes,&quot; I/we said, and one of me/us laughed. &quot;We&#39;re sorry. You and we haven&#39;t spoken in some time. We&#39;re not using to adjusting our idioms.&quot;

&quot;Nor am I accustomed to hearing them,&quot; she confessed. &quot;Returning to the Academy to be among so many of your kind is ... a difficult transition.&quot;

&quot;As is this,&quot; I/we said, gesturing at myselves. &quot;We don&#39;t know how we&#39;re going to get through the next term like this.&quot;

T&#39;Khara raised an eyebrow. &quot;This transformation will be reversed at the end of the term?&quot;

&quot;We hope so,&quot; I/we said. &quot;We don&#39;t know what to do until then.&quot;

&quot;There is no reason we cannot continue to, as you humans put it, &#39;date,&#39;&quot; she said. &quot;I am amenable to the proposition if you are. However, the matter of our shared room must be brought to the attention of the quartermaster. One room cannot accommodate us. You will need to [[seek another|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;move out&quot;]] room.&quot;

&quot;You mean //pon farr//,&quot; I/we said.

&quot;Well remembered,&quot; she said to me/us. &quot;Our seven-year cycles are not always precise, but it is likely that I shall not experience //pon farr// during the course of the term.

I&#39;ll visit you there, how&#39;s that sound?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="132" name="Suvak" tags="" position="550,1150" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $dialogue == 0&gt;&gt;, gay male &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Vulcan.|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;vulcan&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; Department: &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[security,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;security,&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; specialty: forensics. Suvak is a young Vulcan with what would be an excellent academic pedigree for any human. Unfortunately, he is Vulcan, and did not excel enough in his studies to be admitted to the Vulcan Science Academy; the choice of &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[Starfleet|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;starfleet&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; is a distant second. Reasoning that his attraction to science was great but his knowledge of science was insufficient, Suvak has chosen the field of forensics: an applied rather than abstract science with connections to the law. This met with the approval of his father, a well-known judge on the planet Vulcan.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $dialogue == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I found Suvak in the dorm lobby, looking over the public events calendar on the wall monitor.

&quot;Hello, Suvak,&quot; I said to him, giving him a quick smile. &quot;It&#39;s me. Cadet &lt;&lt;if $race != &quot;Trill&quot; and $race != &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;$oldname.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$oldname. Actually, it&#39;s $playerfirst $playername now, for the past couple of days.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;$playername?&quot; he asked, turning to me. There was no change of expression on his Vulcan features as he took in my altered appearance: my female body, &lt;&lt;if $race != &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;my $race features, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $inv.includes(&quot;skirt uniform&quot;)&gt;&gt;my short skirt and bare legs, &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my female-cut uniform, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $boobs gt 8&gt;&gt;my impossibly large breasts, &lt;&lt;elseif $boobs gt 4&gt;&gt;my large rounded breasts, &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my modestly sized breasts, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Bolian&quot;&gt;&gt;my blue-tinted skin, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Bajoran&quot;&gt;&gt;my crinkled nose, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Trill&quot; or $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;my speckled temples, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Vulcan&quot; or $race == &quot;Romulan&quot;&gt;&gt;my arched brows and pointed ears, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Cardassian&quot; or $race == &quot;Klingon&quot;&gt;&gt;my bone-crested forehead, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Ferengi&quot;&gt;&gt;my large protruding ears, &lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Orion&quot;&gt;&gt;my green skin, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;and my general demeanor of &lt;&lt;if $reaction == &quot;love&quot; or $reaction == &quot;opportunity&quot;&gt;&gt;awkwardness and unfamiliarity with my new body.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;adapt&quot; or $reaction == &quot;awkward&quot;&gt;&gt;awkwardness and discomfort with my new body.&lt;&lt;elseif $reaction == &quot;hate&quot; or $reaction == &quot;bizarre&quot;&gt;&gt;confusion and alienation with my new body.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;That is certainly a thorough alteration of your physique,&quot; he commented finally.

&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; I said. &quot;I really have no idea what to make of all of this yet.&quot; I started into an explanation of the encounter with the pirates on board the //Beta Centauri//, because I felt the strange need to talk about it even though he hadn&#39;t asked. To his credit, he listened patiently to the details as I recounted them, and didn&#39;t interrupt me at all.

When I was finished, he said, &quot;Major Hoto, was it?&quot; he asked. &quot;A disgraced Bajoran military commander, formerly working with the government of Orion? That is noteworthy. It would be well if Starfleet were making inquiries.&quot;

&quot;I believe they are,&quot; I said, &quot;but what I hope is that Starfleet figures out a way to undo all of this. I feel very strange as a &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;woman.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Orion&quot;&gt;&gt;woman, especially an Orion woman.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;woman, especially a $race woman.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Vulcan&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;That is perfectly understandable. It is possible that you will experience //pon farr//, the Vulcan mating cycle,&quot; he observed.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Orion&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;That is perfectly understandable. It is possible you possess the well-known mind-affecting pheremones of the Orion females,&quot; he observed.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;human&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;That is perfectly understandable,&quot; he said.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;That is perfectly understandable,&quot; he said. &quot;There are differences in biology and function that go beyond the merely sexual.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I&#39;m not looking forward to this next term,&quot; I grumbled.

&quot;Which brings me to your stated reason for our meeting,&quot; Suvak said. &quot;You stated in your message that we might contemplate a change in our housing arrangement.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $likesboys == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;I admit, when the alien device changed my body, it didn&#39;t completely change everything. I&#39;m still attracted to men. There is no reason to change our relationship yet. We could [[try living together|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;try&quot;]] with you, unless you would find that difficult.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We may have to,&quot; I said. &quot;I don&#39;t want to change anything about our relationship yet, but when that alien device changed my body, it changed around my sexuality as well. I&#39;m more attracted to women now.&quot;

&quot;Then perhaps living together should be avoided this term,&quot; Suvak concluded. &quot;We should find [[different accommodations|A: Dorm Response][$roomdecision to &quot;move out&quot;]] this term.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we found Suvak in the dorm lobby, looking over the public events calendar on the wall monitor.

&quot;Hello, Suvak,&quot; I/we said to him, giving him a quick smile. &quot;It&#39;s us. Cadet $oldname.&quot;

&quot;$playername?&quot; he asked, turning to me/us.

He&#39;s also the one who recommends cadets for promotion.

Cadets do have ranks. Most of the time, it&#39;s just a year-by-year thing: &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[freshman,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;freshman&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[sophomores,|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;sophomore&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[juniors|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;junior&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;gloss&quot;&gt;[[seniors|Menu Glossary][$anchor to &quot;senior&quot;]]&lt;/span&gt; all have their own ranks. Most freshmen are unranked Cadets, with the best of them reaching Cadet Fourth Class. Nearly all of us sophomores will be Cadet Third Class this year -- the most average sophomore outranks the best freshmen, after all. We all remember what it was like when we were first-years, with seemingly everybody outranking us, and most of us have been looking forward to the moment when we could pin those Third Class insigna on our collars. Finally, we&#39;d have some people below us. &lt;&lt;if $promote gt 2&gt;&gt;Sometimes, cadets get promoted above Cadet Third Class as a way of being specially recognized, and to give them additional responsibilities and recognition, but nobody ever really expect it.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Sometimes sophomore cadets get promoted above Cadet Third Class, but nobody ever really expects it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Here&#39;s his letter:

&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;------------------------&lt;/span&gt;

Cadet $oldfirst $oldname:

The administrative staff welcomes back to your second year at Starfleet Academy. We understand that the circumstances of your return are highly unusual, and therefore find it necessary to clarify your Academy status.

Upon your return, it is customary to review your Starfleet record in order to evaluate your continuing progress. Our staff has conducted a thorough review of your academic achievement, your participation, your disciplinary record, and your extracurricular activities.

The officer staff of the Academy took particular interest in your recent performance under strained and unexpected circumstances aboard the //Beta Centauri//. We have spoken with your debriefing officer and examined the relevant records and reports.

First, it is our determination that your experience on the planet Procrustes, and the alien technology which was discovered there, will not negatively influence your record. Although it is a technical violation of Federation Law to make contact with a prohibited planet, it has been determined that this contact was made under duress and was not of your own doing. It will not impugn your status here, and you are welcomed as a returning student.&lt;&lt;if $dup gt 1&gt;&gt;

Second, the medical report and scientific analysis of your duplicaton provided by Dr Pacquet and Lt Cmdr T&#39;Heya of the USS //Leeds// has been reviewed by Dr Yin, chief of our College of Medicine, and Commander Newbury, chief of the Combined Arts and Sciences College. It is their recommendation that you be treated as a single individual whenever possible, but as multiple individuals when it makes sense to do so. In short, the quartermaster will issue multiple living quarters, uniforms, phasers, communicators, and other such supplies; but the academic achievements of &lt;&lt;if $dup == 2&gt;&gt;both&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;all&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; your bodies will continue to accrue under a single name, so your academic prerequisites will be counted cumulatively. We expect and require that you will be re-evaluated by Dr Yin or her staff throughout the year to monitor your ability to keep up with these academic expectations.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $promote lt 3&gt;&gt;In accordance with tradition, upon reaching sophomore status, all students are elevated automatically to the rank of Cadet Third Class unless acknowledged otherwise. As your academic record is adequate but not outstanding, this will be your new rank for the coming term.&lt;&lt;set $rank to &quot;Cadet Third Class&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Of your actions on board the //Beta Centauri// and on the planet Procrustes we would like to make particular note, as below.

&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;leader&quot;)&gt;&gt;You showed particular leadership among your fellow cadets, directing them as needed during the crisis. We have verified your report with the surviving members of your team, and your ability to retain your presence of mind during such a trying time is commendable.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;warrior&quot;)&gt;&gt;On a number of occasions, you demonstrated great bravery in the face of imminent danger. This is the kind of courage that we hope for and expect in our cadets.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;marksman&quot;)&gt;&gt;Few cadets in your situation, with your level of training, are able to use their phasers with such coolness and precision. You are to be congratulated and commended on your excellent marksmanship.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;scrapper&quot;)&gt;&gt;When faced with physical danger, you used your strength and your Academy training to best advantage, even when the confrontations before you became physical. It is not always the best way to handle every given situation, but sometimes it is the only choice available.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;thinker&quot;)&gt;&gt;We would like to recognize your proven ability to concentrate and to think your way through the problems that faced you. It is not easy to use reason, to foresee danger, and to make good decisions under such strain.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;strategist&quot;)&gt;&gt;You have demonstrated a noteworthy ability to think on your feet with tactical precision. Most cadets, when first confronted with danger, forget to use the stun setting on their phasers. Thanks to your quick thinking, lives were saved that may otherwise have been lost.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;protector&quot;)&gt;&gt;We have received report of your bravery and compassion on board the //Beta Centauri//. You choose the path of negotiation, the path of preserving life, rather than that of lethal retaliation. This shows good awareness not only of Federation law, but empathy for your fellow cadets. &lt;&lt;if $hoto == &quot;sedated&quot;&gt;&gt;Thanks to your compassion, the principal offender in the attack might have been taken alive, had it been possible to recover the ship.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $hoto == &quot;killed&quot; or $hoto == &quot;sedated&quot; or $hoto == &quot;stunned&quot;&gt;&gt;Also, we would like to commend you on your ability to target the principal instigator of the attack, identified in our reports as Major Hoto of Bajor. It is unfortunate that &lt;&lt;if $hoto != &quot;killed&quot;&gt;&gt;he and &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;his compatriots cannot be brought to justice, but rest assured, Starfleet is proud of you for having made a start.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
Pursuant to the above, this office hereby recommends that you receive a promotion to Cadet Staff Sergeant.&lt;&lt;set $rank to &quot;Cadet Staff Sgt&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Congratulations.

Admittance code: 0F249A1$promote

Addendum: On a final note, you may expect to receive orders from Starfleet regarding the status of the investigation of your encounter with the pirates who attacked the //Beta Centauri// and forced your ship to the planet Procrustes. __This investigation is not considered classified at this time,__ as several hundred civilians were involved and it is impossible to entirely prevent this encounter from becoming known. However, we ask you not to discuss the Procrustean technology in any detail or to share any tricorder readings you may possess. Your cadet officers have been informed of your transformation, but whether you inform your other classmates is __up to you.__

&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;------------------------&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I just ran into a few people in the Commons&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we just ran into a few people in the Commons&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; -- the large, open indoor space at the center of several Academy lecture halls. To recognize the beginning of the term, the high ceilings were decorated with welcome banners; the skylight gardens were trimmed and lush and green; and a great many signs were hung for the aid of the freshmen. This way to the commissary, that way to the gymnasium, follow the yellow line to find the freshman registration center, and so on. There were a number of tables set out to help students sort out problems with finding classes, obtaining standard-issue equipment, uniform difficulties, and the like. Freshman year at the Academy is highly regimented and there&#39;s not a lot of time to explore, and almost no time to get lost in. Students are pushed from one place to another. In a lot of ways, it&#39;s the most difficult year.

&lt;&lt;display &quot;Race Reactions&quot;&gt;&gt;

There was a small desk for sophomore students looking for similar guidance. It was right next to the tropical garden at the top of the grand stairs. There was probably something symbolic in allowing the sophomores to look down upon the chaos of swirling freshmen cadets from on high.

We were among those fortunate few who had survived Procrustes.

&quot;We made it,&quot; Zoya Allaire said simply. &quot;What a voyage, huh?&quot;

&quot;An understatement,&quot; Darvok said. &lt;&lt;if $ach.includes(&quot;Darvok fights&quot;)&gt;&gt;She frowned, her delicate black-green brows creasing her forehead. She had cut her wavy hair very short and straight, in an Orion parody of a Vulcan bowl cut, and she had adamantly refused to decorate her female body with makeup or jewelry. Darvok was in her sleeveless uniform top, sans jacket, and looked severe and professional. She pursed her lips sternly. &quot;It was a trial for us all.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $ach.includes(&quot;Darvok weak&quot;)&gt;&gt;She nodded wearily, and a long wave of her green-black dipped across her face to conceal her expression. Darvok was wearing the truncated uniform skirt, showing off the smooth and even green skin of her thighs. She tucked away the rogue locks behind one ear, revealing an earring: sparkling ruby-like jewel set in gold. And was she wearing just a touch of makeup? She pursed her pretty lips and sighed. &quot;It was a trial for us all.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;She nodded wearily, and her green-black hair fell across her face to conceal her expression. She tucked it away behind one ear with an annoyed gesture that spoke of much recent practice. She had cut her hair slightly shorter, to make it more manageable, and wore her full uniform: professional, but feminine. &quot;It was a trial for us all.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;Which we passed,&quot; Allaire reminded us all in his new deep voice. &quot;That&#39;s something, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Darvok the former Vulcan was too tired to complain about Allaire&#39;s use of tautologically obvious nonsense, and nodded again. &quot;And you, $oldname?&quot; she asked of &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $host == &quot;Trill name&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Or I should say $playername. How are you adjusting after all of ... that?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;How are you adjusting after all of ... that?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;As well as can be,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said. &quot;Everything here at the Academy seems so ... //normal.// It&#39;s strange.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I noticed that,&quot; Zoya said. &quot;After everything that&#39;s happened, something as ordinary as //school// just seems ... trivial. Insignificant.&quot;

&quot;Lacking consequence,&quot; Darvok said. &quot;Nothing has changed here. The Academy is still a crucial path to a future career. And yet I feel ... feel the same way too.&quot; She seemed surprised to hear herself admit to a feeling, which is probably normal for a Vulcan turned into an Orion.

&lt;&lt;if $lovers[1] gte $approval[1]&gt;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re looking well, $playername,&quot; Cadet Allaire said, looking &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; over. &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m still kind of into boys, to be honest. &lt;&lt;if $muscles gt 15&gt;&gt;I really like all the muscles on you. &lt;&lt;elseif $muscles gt 11&gt;&gt;I like the muscles on you. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;warrior&quot;)&gt;&gt;The way you fought all those pirates ... that&#39;s pretty hot. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;Being a man for the first time, you make it look good.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I think I&#39;m starting to appreciate women more, which is kind of strange, you know? &lt;&lt;if $boobs gt 3 and $boobs lt 14&gt;&gt;Your figure is incredible.

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; chuckled dryly at that. &quot;You said a mouthful there.&quot;

&quot;Boring, I know,&quot; Allaire said, his new deep voice sounding sheepish. &quot;I&#39;m a little worn out for clever observations. How are you holding up?&quot;

&quot;As well as can be,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said. &quot;Everything here at the Academy seems so ... //normal.// It&#39;s strange.&quot;

&quot;It is good to see you again,&quot; Darvok said, attempting a wan smile. &lt;&lt;if $ach.includes(&quot;Darvok fights&quot;)&gt;&gt;Then she frowned, her delicate black-green brows creasing her forehead. She had cut her wavy hair very short and straight, in an Orion parody of a Vulcan bowl cut, and she had adamantly refused to decorate her female body with makeup or jewelry. Darvok was in her sleeveless uniform top, sans jacket, and looked severe and professional. She pursed her lips sternly. &quot;It was an ordeal for us all. I am ... pleased that you survived.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $ach.includes(&quot;Darvok weak&quot;)&gt;&gt;She nodded wearily, and a long wave of her green-black dipped across her face to conceal her expression. Darvok was wearing the truncated uniform skirt, showing off the smooth and even green skin of her thighs. She tucked away the rogue locks behind one ear, revealing an earring: sparkling ruby-like jewel set in gold. And was she wearing just a touch of makeup? She pursed her pretty lips and sighed. &quot;It was an ordeal for us all. I&#39;m really glad you survived.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;She nodded wearily, and her green-black hair fell across her face to conceal her expression. She tucked it away behind one ear with an annoyed gesture that spoke of much recent practice. She had cut her hair slightly shorter, to make it more manageable, and wore her full uniform: professional, but feminine. &quot;It was an ordeal for us all. I am ... happy that you survived.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;As am I,&quot; I said.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;As are we,&quot; I/we said.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;It&#39;s difficult, but we&#39;ll get through this. Are you adjusting well?&quot;

&quot;I believe so. I appreciate the vote of confidence,&quot; Darvok the former Vulcan said. She sounded as if she hadn&#39;t slept much recently. &quot;And you, $oldname?&quot; she asked of &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $host == &quot;Trill name&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Or I should say $playername. How are you adjusting after all of ... that?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;How are you adjusting after all of ... that?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;As well as can be,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said. &quot;Everything here at the Academy seems so ... //normal.// It&#39;s strange.&quot;

&quot;Yes. I have the distinct impression that the Academy routine is trivial, or that it lacks consequence,&quot; Darvok said. &quot;Nothing has changed here. The Academy is still a crucial path to a future career. And yet I feel ... feel the same way. It has lessened.&quot; She seemed surprised to hear herself admit to a feeling, which is probably normal for a Vulcan turned into an Orion.

&lt;&lt;if $likesgirls == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re looking well, at least,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;You look pretty good, all things considered,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said. &quot;Although it looks like you could use some sleep.&quot;

We were among those fortunate few who had survived Procrustes.

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;We make quite the pair, you and I,&quot; Cadet Erelan said, with a half-hearted attempt at humor.

He was pleased to see &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; but it was more an acknowledgement of our shared predicament, a camaraderie of sorts. We were among those fortunate few who had survived Procrustes.

&quot;To fallen friends,&quot; she said to &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; looking and sounding particularly like a Klingon.

We stood in silence for a moment, thinking of the cadets and crew that hadn&#39;t made it off the //Beta Centauri//. After a moment, Pyria added, &quot;I grew up in the Bajoran resistance. You&#39;d think this gets easier, but it never does. We did our best, and we won ... almost. We lost people, and there&#39;s just no way to make that any better.&quot; He looked at his big feet. &quot;A lot of people would want to count me among the casualties too.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said. &quot;This can&#39;t be irreversible. There must be a way to undo at least some of this.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true, though, is it?&quot; Pyria asked, his big male brow clouding up with annoyance and self-loathing. &quot;There //doesn&#39;t// have to be a way to undo this. That&#39;s not how the world works. For all we know, this is how the Procrusteans got their entertainment: a one-way change for all uninvited guests, and then watch how they struggle. And that&#39;s not all: I failed in my duty. Remember, I was on guard, and they just took my prisoner -- the Prophets only know what happened to //him.// Probably a her, now. Nobody knows where he -- she -- is. Can you undo //that?// That prisoner&#39;s escape was on me. And now I&#39;m this ... this big ugly //man.// I&#39;m not even Bajoran any more.&quot; He pulled a piece of ear jewelry out of a pocket of his uniform and held it up to his big, male ear. &quot;Ever see a Klingon wearing Bajoran ear jewels? Didn&#39;t think so.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be so hard on yourself,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; told her. &quot;It was out of our control.&quot;

He was silently for a moment, then sighed. &quot;You&#39;re right, $playername. Of course you&#39;re right. You take a hot-headed Bajoran woman and put her in the body of a male Klingon, you&#39;re going to get some anger issues, am I right? &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Klingon&quot;&gt;&gt;You&#39;re a Klingon, you know what it&#39;s like.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;re not a Klingon, but you can probably guess.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It&#39;s rough.&quot; He looked &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; over &lt;&lt;if $lovers[0] gte $approval[0]&gt;&gt;admiringly. &quot;You didn&#39;t turn out half as bad as I did. You&#39;re lucky. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Cardassian&quot;&gt;&gt;I wouldn&#39;t call a Cardassian pretty, but not bad, either.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Ferengi&quot;&gt;&gt;Almost pretty.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Beautiful, even.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $muscles lt 10&gt;&gt;You&#39;re this tiny little thing compared to me, and ... I kind of like that. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;warrior&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You make me feel protective of you, like I have to keep you safe now. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $boobs gt 3 and $boobs lt 14&gt;&gt;You&#39;ve got ... great breasts. I never thought I&#39;d hear myself tell anoth-- a woman that. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup gt 1&gt;&gt;And so help me, I love the twin thing. You just don&#39;t know how sexy that is. Or maybe you do, I don&#39;t know. &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;You should feel fortunate you ended up looking so ... so nice. That&#39;s not what happened to //me.//&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and nodded, impressed. &quot;I&#39;m not much of a judge of the female body -- well, not yet. You did all right. Better than I did, anyway.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $lovers[8] gt 0 and $lovers[8] lt 20&gt;&gt;There was a tall Trill male, a senior named Cadet 2nd Lt [[Darzol,|A: Cadet Intro][$course to &quot;Darzol&quot;, $gen = &quot;male&quot;]] giving quick instructions on the use of Academy-assigned devices. During the first few days, it was inevitable that somebody&#39;s comm badge didn&#39;t work, or their tricorder was stuck on the wrong setting, or a phaser&#39;s user lock hadn&#39;t been disabled from the previous year.

She was somewhat isolated and standoffish, never really getting familiar with any of her colleagues, and not talking about her past on Bajor.

She was energetic and boisterous, like most Klingons, and stood amidst the swirl of wandering and confused students, unafraid of the storm of perplexity that surrounded her.

This would be her senior year, probably, and she was right here in the Commons in the center of it all, introducing herself to new students and directing them firmly to their destinations. She seemed even more sure of herself this year after her latest promotion.

She looked the way she usually did when some obstacle had got in her way: full of righteous determination. Most Bajoran women didn&#39;t stand for obstacles, a fact &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; also remembered from the lab: something about a titration of silver nitrate that hadn&#39;t been measured correctly.

People gave me strange looks, and generally kept their distance.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Bajoran&quot;&gt;&gt;For some reason, the Bajorans in the commons were giving me dirty looks.

Weird.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Klingon&quot;&gt;&gt;Some Klingons in the commons gave me long, appraising looks. I could see them studying the pattern of bone on my new Klingon forehead in distant, perplexed non-recognition. Perhaps they thought I wasn&#39;t really Klingon, or they just didn&#39;t recognize my lineage or something. It was like something wasn&#39;t right, but I didn&#39;t know what.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Orion&quot;&gt;&gt;All around the commons, I heard the occasional whisper.

Starfleet never had many Orion cadets, and even though I wasn&#39;t one, I was certainly drawing the eyes of the crowd.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Bolian&quot;&gt;&gt;A lot of people in the commons wanted to talk to me, which was a little confusing. Perhaps they thought I were really a Bolian, and since Bolians are known to be garrulous and friendly, everybody thought I was a safe person to ask questions of. It was a little weird for my first real day back at the Academy.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Betazoid&quot;&gt;&gt;All around the commons, I felt I could both see and hear the people around me, but more than that, I could sense a wash of random thoughts. It wasn&#39;t strong enough or clear enough to make sense of, and it was at times a little too much t handle. Apparently these Betazoid telepathic senses worked, although I hadn&#39;t any practice with them.

People glanced my way. I guess I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised. Trills in Starfleet aren&#39;t too common, and most of them are uncommonly skilled in everything. Some Trills even had a century of experience, in a wide number of fields. I wasn&#39;t really a Trill, but I did draw a lot of attention as one.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Vulcan&quot;&gt;&gt;More than a few Vulcans passed through the commons, and most of them gave me a nod: a reserved and collegiate recognition of shared kinship, as two professionals might share.

__ Personal log, stardate 48448.4 __
I had my physical this morning. Dr Pacquet of the USS //Leeds// seemed ... impressed. And he seemed a little worried about something as well.

&quot;As far as I can tell, you&#39;re a perfectly ordinary Trill $newgender,&quot; he confessed, looking over his medical data while I sat on the exam bed. &quot;If this technology is what they say it is, then frankly, I&#39;m stumped. It would be a lot easier with today&#39;s technology to ... I don&#39;t know, clone a body illegally and imprint someone&#39;s synaptic patterns into it. Even that would be pretty far-fetched.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;The female science officer, T&#39;Heya, was present for the exam. &quot;Is there no way to discern this transformation?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;The captain, Kozlov, was present, probably because he was male. &quot;There&#39;s no way at all to tell the difference between a transformed human and a natural-born one?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Dr Pacquet held his hands up, as if trying to shape a cloud of ignorance floating in front of him. &quot;I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s //impossible// to tell. Trill DNA, like human DNA, has a lot of redundant and unused coding. Maybe there are certain ... patterns that have been inserted into unused sections of protein chains, some non-expressed alleles that have been ... I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s certainly not anything obvious, or at least not to me.&quot;

He reviewed the chart again. &quot;No sign of mental tampering,&quot; he observed. &quot;At least on the gross physical level. Cadet $playername&#39;s brain structure is comparable to the brain structure in the transmission logs the last time &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;he&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;she&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; stepped into a transporter.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;A sensible comparison,&quot; T&#39;Heya nodded. &quot;What is your assessment? Is she fit to return to the Academy in her present state?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Huh,&quot; the captain grunted. &quot;And you think it&#39;s safe to send him back to the Academy like this?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I can&#39;t think of a reason not to, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking,&quot; Dr Pacquet told them.

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;And what about this symbiont?&quot; Captain Kozlov asked urgently. &quot;We&#39;re running out of time. Is Cadet $playername going to be a suitable host?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Is there any medical objection to joining Cadet $playername with the Trill symbiont?&quot; Lt Cmdr T&#39;Heya asked.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I think it will work,&quot; Dr Pacquet said, glancing at me, &quot;although we haven&#39;t discussed it yet.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Then now is a good time.&quot; Captain Koslov took a breath and addressed me. &quot;Cadet, as you know, a number of people on board the //Beta Centauri// were transformed by the same Procrustean device that changed your own body. And you probably know that a great many of those were changed to a different alien race, although not all of them.&quot; When I nodded, he went on. &quot;Among the transformed individuals, we found a Trill symbiont. We don&#39;t know who it is that was transformed into this state, but we know that there&#39;s a limited amount of time that a symbiont can remain outside a host body before it dies. The Trill government doesn&#39;t know what to do with it, because it isn&#39;t actually a Trill citizen -- at least as far as we know -- and the usual rules of competitive hosting don&#39;t apply. There aren&#39;t any Trill hosts who are willing to take this new symbiont on board, even if the government would let them.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; I asked.

&quot;There&#39;s too much risk,&quot; the captain said. &quot;This isn&#39;t really a Trill symbiont, you understand. It could be a Romulan agent. Or one of the pirates that attacked you. It could be ... well, anybody. And when a symbiont is joined with a host, it has access too all the host&#39;s memories -- and control over the host&#39;s body. It&#39;s too much risk,&quot; he said again. &quot;So unless this symbiont can find a host, it will die. And that&#39;s where you come in.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;Lt Cmdr T&#39;Heya nodded. &quot;Very well. I will inform the cadet.&quot; Turning to me, she began: &quot;Cadet $playername, when our shuttles scanned for life signs in the Procrustean ruins, we discovered a Trill symbiont. It is likely a transformed passenger, or member of the crew, of the //Beta Centauri//. Because a symbiont cannot survive outside a host for more than a few dozen hours, we have tried to contact the Trill government to arrange for a viable host.&quot; I nodded, and she went on. &quot;Unfortunately, this particular symbiont is not known to the Trill government, and they refuse to put the unknown symbiont through its usual host selection process.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; I asked.

&quot;A Trill symbiont can access all the memories of its host body,&quot; the science officer explained, &quot;and controls its motor functions. As the identity of the symbiont is unknown, and as the host body would have no secrets from the symbiont, the Trill government is unwilling to expose any Trill citizens to such a joining. The survival of the symbiont now depends upon you, if you are willing.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;So you want me to take this symbiont on board?&quot; I asked. &quot;And then it will control me? I&#39;ll just be a vessel?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;The captain nodded. &quot;Yes. If you are willing.&quot; He paused, and added, &quot;I won&#39;t order you to do this, but you could very well save a life if you do.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Essentially, yes,&quot; T&#39;Heya said. &quot;This is not an order, cadet. It must be a course chosen willingly by you.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

I asked how it would affect my Starfleet career, of course, but the answer to that was unclear. Apparently, once the symbiont was implanted inside me, we could then identify who that symbiont had been prior to the transformation. The Trill government could begin to arrange a new host once that person&#39;s identity and background could be confirmed and evaluated. Meanwhile, I could attend Starfleet Academy until we learned how to reverse the Procrustean transformation.

&quot;All right,&quot; I said to Dr Pacquet. &quot;[[Let&#39;s do it.|DB: Trill Surgery]]&quot;

It&#39;s nearly midnight, and apparently a lot has happened since the pirates attacked the ship. I don&#39;t remember what happened, because everything went dark for a long time, but I can remember what happened to Cadet $oldfirst since then, and everything has become a lot clearer. I&#39;m using &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;her body, too, and we&#39;re sharing her&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;his body, too, and we&#39;re sharing his&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; memories, which is strange. We both got turned into &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;men&lt;&lt;set $likesgirls to 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $likesboys to 0&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $neworient to &quot;straight male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;women&lt;&lt;set $likesgirls to 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $likesboys to 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $neworient to &quot;bi female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; or whatever the symbiont equivalent is, so that&#39;s what we are now. And I can remember filling out all these personal logs, even though it wasn&#39;t me doing it.

They did the surgery immediately after telling me -- telling $oldfirst, I mean, I was sitting in a jar or something -- about trying to do the surgical joining. It&#39;s not the first time a Starfleet surgeon has done the surgery, apparently. I didn&#39;t even know the Trills were symbionts, but apparently $oldfirst did. Well, let&#39;s face it, a lot of people didn&#39;t know until a couple of years ago.

It&#39;ll be weird to go back to Starfleet Academy. I was an officer before all this happened, although no longer serving actively. I made the rank of lieutenant aboard the //Kyushu// as a nurse assistant, but I ended up getting hurt on an away mission. Nerve damage. I couldn&#39;t stand for long periods any more. Honorable discharge, and I went back to living a civilian life. Then came Wolf 359 and the battle with the Borg. If I&#39;d still been on board ... well, I wasn&#39;t, thank God, but my &lt;&lt;if $gender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;wife&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;husband&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; had been on the //Saratoga//. My whole life seemed to end. For a year after Wolf 359, it felt like one long funeral interspersed with medical appointments. In fact, I was on my way to Starfleet Medical on Earth to get treatment for my neurological condition when //this// happened. $oldfirst feels the same way: our lives were just rudely interrupted.

Now I&#39;m healthy again, thanks to $oldfirst&#39;s generosity. Even though I&#39;m a &lt;&lt;if $newgender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;man&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;woman&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; now, it&#39;s like I&#39;m getting a second chance to start over. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen with this Procrustean device, or if what it did can ever be undone, but I&#39;m not about to let the opportunity slip by. If it&#39;s possible that it can transform me from ... from whatever //this// is that I&#39;ve become, back into a human, then maybe it can turn me into a //whole// human, and maybe $playername can have &lt;&lt;if $gender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;his&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;her&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; old life back too. I know I have to try, and $oldfirst agrees.&lt;&lt;set $playername to &quot;Val&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $aka to 1&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;display &quot;A: Arrival Link&quot;&gt;&gt;

For now, we&#39;re going to go by the name of $oldfirst $playername, the way the Trill do it. $oldfirst to commemorate the name of my body, and $playername for my name. Man, it&#39;ll be weird having people call me cadet all over again. I hope they can get that sorted out.

Clearly, he didn&#39;t recognize &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; like this. Perhaps [[re-introductions|A: Cadet Reveal]] were in order -- or &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; could just give him a false name, and [[not tell him.|A: Cadet Not Reveal]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\

He was evidently pleased about his promotion to Cadet Squad Sergeant, and was effusively introducing himself as such to everybody. There might have been a little flicker in his expression as he &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;saw me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;saw us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; standing before him, something that threw him: cadets he didn&#39;t recognize. Harran liked to know everyone, and had a good memory for faces and names.

&quot;Don&#39;t know &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;you,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;either of you,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; he said, warm and friendly but perplexed. &quot;Welcome back to the Academy ... sophomore, is it? Well done.&quot;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 3&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I doubted that he recognized me, or even remembered who I was last year. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;$oldname&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; had been a freshman. I suppose I could [[introduce myself|A: Cadet Reveal]] and explain what had happened, or just&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we doubted that he recognized me/us, or even remembered who I/we were last year. I/we supposed I/we could just [[introduce myselves|A: Cadet Reveal]] and explain what had happened, or just&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; [[not tell him.|A: Cadet Not Reveal]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Philip&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t mind me,&quot; Philip said as &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I sat down across the table from&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we sat down on either side of the table from&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; him. &quot;I&#39;m just making a few repairs. Oh, not you,&quot; he said to the communicator, adding, &quot;Look, I&#39;ll call you back. I have the case open, I&#39;m pretty far along. All right, goodbye.&quot; He double-tapped his comm badge and allowed it to go silent.

&quot;So,&quot; he said after a moment, after barely glancing up at &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and returning his gaze to his disassembled PADD. &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Twins, eh?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Sophomore, eh?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re here to learn, you&#39;re welcome to watch if you stay quiet. &lt;&lt;if $lovers[6] gte $approval[6]&gt;&gt;If you&#39;re here to talk to me, well, I&#39;m flattered, but&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;If you&#39;re here to talk to me, then don&#39;t, because&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a bit busy.&quot;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 4&gt;&gt;

I simply chose a visible location for meeting my sister Tirak, who joins me this year at the Academy.&quot;

&quot;No, nothing like that,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said.

He looked at me again, the Vulcan eyes probing. &quot;Are you also waiting for someone? Or do you wish to speak to me?&quot;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 5&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;He would know me if I told him [[my name,|A: Cadet Reveal]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;He would know me/us if I/we told him [[my/our name,|A: Cadet Reveal]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; but perhaps it would be better [[not to tell him.|A: Cadet Not Reveal]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Tras&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Well, well,&quot; Tras said in an open, friendly way as &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; stopped him in the Commons. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Bolian&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Another Bolian!

I&#39;m going into science this year. Xenolinguistics, I believe. I&#39;ve always wanted to learn Klingon. You know, they have the electronic translators, but they just don&#39;t seem to be the same as learning a language for yourself, don&#39;t you find?&quot;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 6&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;He would know me if I told him [[my name,|A: Cadet Reveal]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;He would know me/us if I/we told him [[my/our name,|A: Cadet Reveal]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; but perhaps it would be better [[not to tell him.|A: Cadet Not Reveal]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Ordro&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; went up to the lost-looking Betazoid cadet to see if he needed anything. &quot;I apologize,&quot; he said immediately. &quot;I feel as if I&#39;m in the way. There&#39;s so many people here. So many voices. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Betazoid&quot;&gt;&gt;You&#39;re a Betazoid, too, you know what I&#39;m talking about. The crowds.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I&#39;m a Betazoid -- a telepath. It&#39;s not easy being in an unfamiliar crowd.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; He extended a hand in greeting, then rolled his eyes at himself in exasperation. &quot;I should introduce myself. I&#39;m Ordro Nox. I mean, I&#39;m Cadet Nox. Is it Nox, or do I say Cadet Ordro?&quot; He looked sheepish. &quot;My family has never gone into Starfleet before me. I&#39;m the first. It&#39;s rather new to me.&quot;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 7&gt;&gt;

There was no way Cadet Ordro would have recognized &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me, given that he was a freshman this year.

Of course, Darzol was a senior and there&#39;s no reason for him to have known &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;my&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my/our&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; name, but he still obviously searched his memory for &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;my&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my/our&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; identity. &quot;Welcome back, $rank,&quot; he said. &quot;Are you here to assist?&quot; He gestured to the tables behind him. &quot;We&#39;re well-staffed at the moment. A number of volunteers are already in place, although I believe Cadet Mills may need a break soon. Are you comfortable assisting first-year cadets with finding their lecture halls on campus?&quot; He hesitated, seeing &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;my&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my/our&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; reluctance to respond. &quot;Or is there something else I can do?&quot;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 8&gt;&gt;

She clearly wore her new insignia with pride.

I&#39;m not giving up my Bajoran identity just because Starfleet says so.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Are you going to complain about my ear jewelry too? What of it?&quot; She seemed to have automatically assumed &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; were against her. &quot;All Bajorans wear ear jewelry. It&#39;s part of our cultural heritage. I&#39;m not about to give up on my Bajoran identity just because some Starfleet regulation says so.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you go through this last year?&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; asked curiously. &quot;There was --&quot;

&quot;Yes, exactly!&quot; she interrupted &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; venting her exasperation in a broad hand gesture, as if presenting &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; as a corroborating witness to the hapless junior behind the table, a half-Vulcan by the look of him. As quickly as she had assumed &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I was her enemy, now she assumed I was her ally.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we were her enemies, now she assumed I/we were her allies.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;I //did// already go through this last year, //actually//, and thank the Prophets that at least somebody remembers it.&quot; She looked down at the half-Vulcan helping her. &quot;Check my records. I&#39;m sure somebody wrote down something about it.&quot;

&quot;I have no access to cadet records,&quot; the junior half-Vulcan answered. &quot;I would discuss this with the quartermaster.&quot;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 18&gt;&gt;

&quot;Him? He&#39;s useless,&quot; Cadet Preelo said bitterly.

&quot;Until then, I recommend you refrain from wearing your jewelry unless you have specific authorization,&quot; the half-Vulcan cadet went on. &quot;However, that is merely my opinion on the matter.&quot;

Preelo Orja rolled her eyes and sighed heavily, turning back to &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; with a look of curiously focused interest. &quot;Do I know you?&quot; she asked abruptly. &quot;You seem to remember me from last year, but I don&#39;t recognize you. You weren&#39;t in that chemistry lab, were you?&quot; She shook her head, her short hair tossing back and forth. &quot;It&#39;s like everybody in freshman year remembers that argument I had with my lab partner. She was doing the titration //wrong.// I had to say something.&quot;

Obviously Cadet Preelo didn&#39;t recognize &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; like this.

Perhaps it was because I looked like a Betazoid also. Then she added, &quot;Is there something I can do to help you?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Almost automatically, she added, &quot;I&#39;m a Betazoid, in case you&#39;re wondering how I knew your name. Many of us are telepaths. Can I help you?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;No, thanks,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;The campus is pretty familiar, although they&#39;ve changed a few things since my day.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;The campus is pretty familiar by now.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

If there&#39;s anything else ... there seems to be something bothering you,&quot; she said, changing her sentence midway. &quot;I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but if it&#39;s something you need to discuss with someone, I can point you in the direction of someone who could help.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I doubt it,&quot; I said dryly.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We doubt it,&quot; I/we said dryly.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;You never know unless you ask,&quot; she said. Around this time she introduced herself as Nixa Utax, from Betazed, and explained about her telepathy. &quot;I&#39;m not a strong telepath, by any means, but I can pick up simple thoughts,&quot; she explained. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Betazoid&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;You might be a better telepath than I, I think.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Not as strong as some from my planet.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 19&gt;&gt;

She didn&#39;t know &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;my&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my/our&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; recent history on board the //Beta Centauri//, then. Perhaps &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I could explain what had happened to me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we could explain what had happened to me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; after [[proper introductions|A: Cadet Reveal]] were made, or perhaps it would be better [[not to mention it yet.|A: Cadet Not Reveal]]

It&#39;s been a little while since I&#39;ve made an entry in my log, so I&#39;m trying to catch up here.

First: I&#39;m on board the USS //Leeds//, a Nebula-class Federation starship that was sent to evacuate the planet Procrustes via remote-piloted shuttlecraft. The captain of the //Leeds//, a man named Koslov, didn&#39;t want to bring the ship in too close, and stayed well out of range of the Procrustean transporter.

Second: Cadet Darvok &lt;&lt;if $survivors[2] == 1&gt;&gt;and Cadet Erelan &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;made it off the planet in one piece. That&#39;s the good news. The bad news is that we haven&#39;t figured out yet how to reverse the transformations that the Procrustean transporters did to us all. Darvok &lt;&lt;if $survivors[2] == 1&gt;&gt;is still an Orion woman, and Erelan is still a Vulcan female.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;is still an Orion woman.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Third: I&#39;m in somebody else&#39;s body.&lt;&lt;set $changereveal to 2&gt;&gt;

When I tried to use the Procrustean transporter array, it changed my race, just the way it changed Darvok&#39;s from Vulcan to Orion when it transported her down.

Symbionts can&#39;t live outside a host body for more than a few dozen hours, maybe four days at the most, and I had to have a new host body right away.

I didn&#39;t know that at the time, of course. All I knew is that everything went dark and confusing for a while, then suddenly I felt like I had eyes and ears and hands and feet again. And when I opened them and set up and looked around, I could hear another voice inside my head saying, //I can&#39;t control my body, I&#39;m not doing this,// and //who are you?//&lt;&lt;set $playername to $playerfirst&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $playerfirst to &quot;Brook&quot;&gt;&gt;

Brook had &lt;&lt;if $gender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;his&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;her&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; sex changed and was transformed into a Trill host female, and when the crew of the //Leeds// discovered I was an unknown Trill symbiont, they put two and two together and transplanted me into Brook&#39;s body -- with &lt;&lt;if $gender == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;his&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;her&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; kind consent, of course. And part of sharing Brook&#39;s body is that we remember all of each other&#39;s memories, although I&#39;m the one who&#39;s in charge of working the body.

They couldn&#39;t put me into the body of a Trill of the right sex. There was something objection from the Trill government -- they didn&#39;t know who I was at the time, and if I wasn&#39;t a Trill citizen, none of the hosts would want some strange imposter Trill operating their body and absorbing their thoughts. So I had to have Brook&#39;s; it was the only way.

Luckily for me, we&#39;re allowed to continue my career back at Starfleet Academy. Brook doesn&#39;t mind, and I think it&#39;ll make things a lot easier to have some additional memories to rely on. I just hope things haven&#39;t changed too much at the Academy since I ... since Brook was last there. It&#39;ll be confusing enough having people call me by my new Trill name: $playerfirst $playername.&lt;&lt;set $aka to 1&gt;&gt;

&quot;Ah. Yes, this is true,&quot; he said, his smile fading somewhat. &quot;Never heard of anyone going through ... what you have.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; he said at last, when &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; finished. &quot;It&#39;s so ... I don&#39;t know what kind of technology could even //do// that. And you&#39;re a woman?&quot; he asked. &quot;Used to be, I mean? That&#39;s amazing. I would //never// have guessed.

If it was a trick, they probably wouldn&#39;t have let you back -- not that I&#39;m saying it //was// a trick, but --&quot; Now the thoughts were flooding back in, fast, as he began to think about the implications. &quot;Undetectable transfiguration of living tissue to precisely replicate another species. All except the cultural knowledge, I presume. The medical applications alone ...&quot; He looked back up at &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;Sorry, $playerfirst.  &lt;&lt;if $lovers[4] gte $approval[4]&gt;&gt;I know I think about things too much; I can&#39;t help it.

Well, these things happen out in the deeps of space, you know. You hear about it all the time.

Human idiom is very strange. You&#39;d think the plural would be appropriate, but that&#39;s the odd thing. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Klingon&quot;&gt;&gt;If you plan to learn Klingonese, I could tell you a thing or two about those lateral affricates that are so hard to pronounce.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Vulcan&quot;&gt;&gt;If you plan to learn Vulcan, I&#39;ve got a thing or two to say about the honorifics, if you need help.&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Bolian&quot;&gt;&gt;If you&#39;re planning to learn Bolian, don&#39;t bother.

A lot of Bajoran words have specific religious contexts and you don&#39;t want to put a foot wrong.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;If you ever want to learn another language, look me up.

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I nodded.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we nodded.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Bolians sure did like to talk.

Alandra carried right on where she&#39;d left off. &quot;And forgive me for saying so, but you &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Bolian&quot;&gt;&gt;make one fine-looking man, if I do say so myself.

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Denjik&quot;&gt;&gt;Cadet Denjik listened in horror. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; she breathed. &quot;No, no, you can&#39;t. You just can&#39;t. That doesn&#39;t //happen// out in space. Tell me it doesn&#39;t happen,&quot; she begged &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us.

&quot;We&#39;re afraid so,&quot; I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said.

She closed her eyes. For a long time she was silent, and &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; wondered if she were going to speak again. Then she said, with her eyes still closed, &quot;I grew up on Bajor. You know about Bajor?

Shot.&quot; She took a deep breath and opened her eyes. &lt;&lt;if $survivors[3] == 0&gt;&gt;&quot;You know when you said you tried to save your friend, Darvok? That sounds exactly like something that happened to me. I -- I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t talk about it. Just know that I know exactly what that&#39;s like. I know how you must feel.&lt;&lt;elseif $surv lt 2&gt;&gt;&quot;You know how you said most of the cadets you were with didn&#39;t make it? That sounds like my whole childhood. I can&#39;t really -- let&#39;s not talk about that right now. Just know ... I know how you feel.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;When you were talking about the pirates, the people coming to try to kill you ... guns everywhere, people threatening you ... that was my whole childhood. I don&#39;t really want to talk about it, but I want you to know that I understand how you feel.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I wanted to come to Bajor to get away from all ... all of that horror. The rebuilding, the ... dismantling the internment camps, the ... the graves. I don&#39;t want it to be like that here, too,&quot; she finished simply. She put her hand on &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;mine.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;one of mine/ours.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;If you need to talk to someone, I can be there. I&#39;ll try.&quot;

Despite her evident distress, &lt;&lt;if $lovers[15] gte $approval[15]&gt;&gt;she did appear willing to talk to &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me, and I debated whether I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us, and I/we debated whether I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; should [[flirt|A: Cadet Flirt]] with her or [[not.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;she seemed strong enough to handle anything the Academy could throw at her.

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Ekotha&quot;&gt;&gt;Cadet Ekotha listened to &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;my&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my/our&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; story with a mixture of concern and respect. Clearly, there had been great danger; but just as clearly, &lt;&lt;if $dup&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; at least had survived it.

&quot;That is the kind of story that makes a Klingon&#39;s blood race,&quot; she declared firmly, pounding her chest with one fist. &quot;And that is the kind of danger //I// would choose to face. I am envious of you, $rank $playername.&quot;

&quot;If you had been there, you would have been transformed into a man,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; reminded her.

&quot;No matter,&quot; she said dismissively. &quot;I would welcome the challenge regardless. I would consider such a transformation simply a scar of a battle well fought, as should you.&quot; She regarded me with something like &lt;&lt;if $lovers[16] gte $approval[16]&gt;&gt;respect. &quot;You make me proud to be Starfleet, $rank $playername. &lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;warrior&quot;)&gt;&gt;You fought as a Klingon warrior would have done.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $rank == &quot;Cadet Staff Sgt&quot;&gt;&gt;You fought well, and should wear your new rank with pride.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Someday, battles such as yours will be //my// battles as well.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;pride. &quot;You make me eager to be Starfleet again, $rank $playername. Tomorrow, these will be //my// battles as well.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $lovers[16] gte $approval[16]&gt;&gt;She seemed interested in &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me, and I debated whether I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us, and I/we debated whether I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; should [[flirt|A: Cadet Flirt]] with her or [[not.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;She seemed proud to have heard &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;my&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my/our&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; story.

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Katya&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m getting the feeling that there&#39;s something strange about your situation,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;apart from the obvious, of course. It&#39;s hard to say why, exactly.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I waited expectantly for her to continue. When she didn&#39;t, I asked, &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we waited expectantly for her to continue. When she didn&#39;t, I/we asked, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&quot;Was it something somebody said? Something you read?&quot;

The senior cadet shook her head, tossing her black locks back and forth. &quot;More like ... something they didn&#39;t say. Normally we get a list of reference numbers pertaining to the case we&#39;re discussing. Suppose some situation comes up -- a complaint, or a fight on campus or an injured cadet -- we get all the file numbers. Files on each cadet, any new files that get opened by Starfleet ... it&#39;s standard procedure. With yours, I&#39;d swear there was a file missing.&quot;

&quot;Missing?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a case file on //you//, of course,&quot; Cadet Fl Cmdr Fumiko said in a low voice. &quot;And there was a file opened on the pirates, and another file on the missing ship. But they didn&#39;t mention any file on the planet itself. No new file, no existing file, no nothing. I wonder if it&#39;s been classified or something -- but no, they said we could talk to the staff as needed about your situation.&quot;

&quot;So somebody knows about it?&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; asked.

&quot;And they don&#39;t want anybody to know that they know, I suppose,&quot; Katya concluded. &quot;$playername, &lt;&lt;if $lovers[17] gte $approval[17]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;strategist&quot;)&gt;&gt;I think you did really well on that flight. You thought your way through all the problems in front of you and you came back alive.&lt;&lt;elseif $rep.includes(&quot;warrior&quot;)&gt;&gt;I&#39;m really proud of the way you performed on that flight. You fought like hell and you came out of it alive.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I&#39;m really impressed by the way you came out of that situation alive. It&#39;s the kind of trial most cadets never have to face -- myself included.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not trying to make you suspicious of the way Starfleet is handling your case, I&#39;m just ... trying to keep you from getting hurt. You&#39;re almost like one of //my// students, and I take that responsibility seriously. Just watch out for yourself, okay?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t know if I should really tell you any of this. I hadn&#39;t planned to -- we just ran into each other by accident, although I&#39;m glad we did. I also can&#39;t tell you what you should do with this information. I think of the lowerclassmen students as ... my responsibility. I don&#39;t want any of you getting hurt. Just watch out for yourself, okay?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

When it was finally told, she snapped it shut so firmly, her perfect white teeth clicked. &quot;You,&quot; she declared, &quot;are &lt;&lt;if $lovers[18] gte $approval[18]&gt;&gt;amazing.

No, I&#39;m talking about all that business with the pirates. You should not have got away, and yet you did.

This ... Major Hoto. That&#39;s not even a Bajoran name. You know what I think? I think he wasn&#39;t Bajoran at all. He probably used the technology on that planet to make himself //look// Bajoran. Maybe I&#39;m just trying to defend Bajor, but I&#39;m serious. I think he&#39;s some kind of impostor.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;That explains a great deal about you,&quot; she said understandingly, when &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I was&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we were&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; through. &quot;I sensed something odd about you, as if your thoughts were ... scrambled, somehow.

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Harran&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $sigother.push(3)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $lovers[3] += 20&gt;&gt;Harran seemed to be really into &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $secret[3] == 0&gt;&gt;for some reason. We really hit it off.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;despite everything that&#39;s changed. It didn&#39;t deter him at all.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It feels good, considering how weird things have been, to feel like there&#39;s somebody on my side.

&lt;&lt;if $secret[3] == 0&gt;&gt;It&#39;s hard to say how he&#39;ll react when &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I tell him who I am. I&#39;ll&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we tell him who I/we are. We&#39;ll&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; cross that bridge later.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Time will tell how well he accepts what&#39;s happened.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Philip&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $sigother.push(4)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $lovers[4] += 20&gt;&gt;It took a little convincing, because Philip has to intellectualize everything, but he finally understood that &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I was&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we were&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; flirting with him, once he stopped being self-deprecating. He&#39;s very critical of himself, it seems. Still, &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; can see he enjoyed the attention.

&lt;&lt;if $secret[4] == 0&gt;&gt;Eventually, he&#39;ll have to be told about what happened on Procrustes.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Eventually, he&#39;ll have more questions about what happened on Procrustes.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a problem for later.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Dorav&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $sigother.push(5)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $lovers[5] += 20&gt;&gt;It&#39;s probably never easy flirting with a Vulcan. After listening to &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;my&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my/our&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; clumsy attempts at human social cues, he finally asked me directly. You&#39;d think &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&#39;d&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we had&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; heard of Vulcans before now, right?

Anyway, it seemed to work, because Dorav said he&#39;d be willing to consider an ongoing social arrangement. That&#39;s about as good as &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; could expect. &lt;&lt;if $secret[5] == 0&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t know what he&#39;ll do when he finds out that I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we don&#39;t know what he&#39;ll do when he finds out that I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&#39;m just glad he understands that I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we are just glad he understands that I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; chatted for a few minutes, and started talking about our Starfleet plans. &quot;What are &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;you&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;you two girls&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; going to study?

&quot;And you like helping everybody,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said.

&quot;Of course. That&#39;s what Starfleet does, really. That&#39;s why I joined,&quot; he explained. &quot;I want to be there for people.

Or steal things. Mostly fixing. Ship crashed, most of the crew were killed, I was hurt pretty bad, but mostly I got lucky. Got picked up by a Federation ship. Put into an orphanage. Raised here on Earth.&quot; He crossed his huge arms, and his biceps bulged in his uniform jacket. &quot;No complaints. They tried to raise me with Orion culture. Almost an idealized Orion culture. Not the crime rings and slavers and the trade-route raiders I grew up with, but the real old culture. Guess that&#39;s why I&#39;m in Starfleet. Not going back to all of that.&quot;

He was honest, forthright and direct, unlike most Orion men. &lt;&lt;if $lovers[3] gte $approval[3]&gt;&gt;He also seemed pretty interested in &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me. I wasn&#39;t&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us. I/we weren&#39;t&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; sure if &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; should [[flirt|A: Cadet Flirt]] with him or [[not.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;We would probably be [[friends.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Philip&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t mind me,&quot; Philip said as &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I sat down across the table from&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we sat down on either side of the table from&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; him. &quot;I&#39;m just making a few repairs. Oh, not you,&quot; he said to the communicator, adding, &quot;Look, I&#39;ll call you back. I have the case open, I&#39;m pretty far along. All right, goodbye.&quot; He double-tapped his comm badge and allowed it to go silent.

&quot;So,&quot; he said after a moment, after barely glancing up at &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and returning his gaze to his disassembled PADD. &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;Twins, eh?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Sophomore, eh?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re here to learn, you&#39;re welcome to watch if you stay quiet. &lt;&lt;if $lovers[4] gte $approval[4]&gt;&gt;If you&#39;re here to talk to me, well, I&#39;m flattered, but&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;If you&#39;re here to talk to me, then don&#39;t, because&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a bit busy.&quot;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 4&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I introduced myself with a fake name,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we introduced ourselves with a couple of fake names,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; inventing something on the spot. He spent most of his time paying attention to the device on the table in front of him. &quot;And you&#39;re &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;a sophomore? I don&#39;t remember seeing you&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;both sophomores? I don&#39;t remember seeing the two of you&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; in any of my other classes, &lt;&lt;if $approval[4] gte $approval[6]&gt;&gt;but I&#39;m not very good at faces.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;but I don&#39;t pay much attention to people.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Better with machines. That&#39;s why I&#39;m going into engineering. How about you?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; made up something about &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;engineering&quot;&gt;&gt;why we might not have run across each other in the engineering department. It was a big campus, after all.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;joining the $dept department, and how that explained why we hadn&#39;t met before. It was a big campus, after all.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Philip seems to accept that explanation.

&lt;&lt;if $lovers[4] gte $approval[4]&gt;&gt;&quot;You know, I&#39;m not much of a people person, but I&#39;d like to talk to you some more -- just not right now,&quot; he said, gesturing to the disassembled PADD.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Look, I&#39;m not much of a people person. I don&#39;t mind making friends at the Academy -- just not right now,&quot; he said, gesturing to the disassembled PADD.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;I&#39;m trying to fix this for a friend.&quot;

Philip seemed a bit distracted at the moment, although &lt;&lt;if $lovers[2] gte $approval[2]&gt;&gt;he seemed to like &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;well enough. &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I wasn&#39;t&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we weren&#39;t&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; sure if this was a good time to [[flirt|A: Cadet Flirt]] with him or [[not.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;We would probably be [[friends.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Dorav&quot;&gt;&gt;Dorav watched coolly as &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; approached, shifting the uniform he was carrying to drape over the opposite arm. &quot;$rank,&quot; he said with a professional nod. &quot;If you are here to object to my possible impedance of the flow of traffic, I believe I am not obstructing access to the stair behind me. I simply chose a visible location for meeting my sister Tirak, who joins me this year at the Academy.&quot;

&quot;No, nothing like that,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said.

He looked at me again, the Vulcan eyes probing. &quot;Are you also waiting for someone? Or do you wish to speak to me?&quot;&lt;&lt;set $idx to 5&gt;&gt;

Dorav seemed very stiff and formal, but then again, he was a Vulcan. It would take a measured approach. &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I was&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We were&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; just trying to make your acquaintance,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;said. &quot;If you have a moment.&quot;

&quot;As you wish,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not an ideal time. I have only a short window in which to discuss pleasantries while I await the arrival of my sibling.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I understand,&quot; I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We understand,&quot; I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said, smiling. &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;medicine&quot;&gt;&gt;Dorav was also in&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Dorav was taking&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; medicine, so &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; used that an excuse to speak to him. &quot;It&#39;s good to know people in &lt;&lt;if $dept == &quot;medicine&quot;&gt;&gt;the department,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;other departments,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said.

&quot;Is it?&quot; he asked with typical Vulcan blandness. &quot;I had not been aware of any advantages to this.&quot; Dorav appraised &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; for a long moment, then turned his attention back to scanning the crowds of students. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Vulcan&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Forgive my saying so, but you do not seem to be a typical Vulcan.&quot;

&quot;I am not,&quot; I replied, making something up. &quot;I was raised by human parents.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said, not glancing my way. &quot;I hope this does not interfere with your academic pursuits here at the Academy. I understand the Vulcanian contingent is often expected to exceed the normal parameters of the human grading curve.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;human&quot; or $race == &quot;Klingon&quot; or $race == &quot;Orion&quot; or $race == &quot;Bajoran&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Forgive my saying so, but I have a particular interest in $race physiology and culture. &lt;&lt;if $lovers[5] gte $approval[5]&gt;&gt;I find your people most fascinating and even ...  attractive.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I have been reading extensively on the subject.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&quot;I hope I meet your expectations,&quot; I replied with a smile.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said, not glancing my way. &quot;I hope at some point we can speak further so I might compare your particular experiences to the academic positions found in the research.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Romulan&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Forgive my pointed observation,&quot; he said, &quot;but I was unaware there were any Romulans attending Starfleet Academy, given the state of mutual hostility that exists between Romulus and the Federation.&quot;

&quot;I am an unusual case,&quot; I admitted.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said, not glancing my way. &quot;Unfortunately, I regret that I am, perhaps, too well-informed of the history of the Romulan people to be entirely comfortable pursuing this ...  acquaintance. Perhaps another time.&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $race == &quot;Ferengi&quot; or $race == &quot;Cardassian&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Forgive my saying so,&quot; he said, &quot;but I was unaware there were any $race students in Starfleet Academy, given the state of mutual hostility that exists between your people and the Federation.&quot;

&quot;I am an unusual case,&quot; I admitted.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said, not glancing my way. &quot;Unfortunately, I regret that I am, perhaps, too well-informed of the history your people to be entirely comfortable pursuing this ...  acquaintance. Perhaps another time.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Forgive my saying so,&quot; he said, &quot;but I am ill-adapted to make an immediate aquaintance with a $race at this time. My reading on your culture has been sparse and somewhat limited.&quot;

&quot;As is mine,&quot; I admitted. &quot;I&#39;m a special case. Raised by human parents.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said, not glancing my way. &quot;In many ways, then, you are better prepared for life at Starfleet Academy than I, having had more personal experience with humans.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Romulan&quot; or $race == &quot;Cardassian&quot; or $race == &quot;Ferengi&quot;&gt;&gt;Dorav didn&#39;t seem much interested in talking after that, so &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; decided to [[talk to someone else.|A: Commons]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Dorav was a pretty engaging fellow, for a Vulcan. Standoffish and formal, certainly. &lt;&lt;if $lovers[5] gte $approval[5]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I wasn&#39;t&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we weren&#39;t&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; sure if &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; should [[flirt|A: Cadet Flirt]] with him or [[not.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;We would probably be [[friends.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Tras&quot;&gt;&gt;Tras was just as friendly as I remembered him from our classes last year, even though he didn&#39;t recognize me in this new shape. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Bolian&quot;&gt;&gt;Of course the sociable Bolians would all recognize one another at the Academy. I should have thought of that.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Of course the sociable Bolians would want to make friends with everyone. I should have known.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I made up a name&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we made up some names&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; on the spot, just to get the conversation rolling.&lt;&lt;set $idx to 6&gt;&gt;

Unfortunately, &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I accidentally let slip that I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we accidentally let slip that I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; had arrived at the Academy on the //Beta Centauri//. It was unintentional. Tras was just a really good conversationalist, constantly talking, always friendly, and it was hard not to want to offer &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;my&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my/our&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; end of the conversation. It was a good thing that Tras hadn&#39;t heard much about the pirate attack.

&quot;The //Beta Centauri//, eh?&quot; he asked. &quot;I heard there was a pirate attack in the shipping lanes. Wasn&#39;t that the ship? That&#39;s odd. But of course you must have come in on a different flight, yes? Of course. That ship probably makes that same run all the time. Well, how lucky for you that you weren&#39;t on board, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; agreed, and the conversation turned to our studies at the Academy. &quot;What I want to know,&quot; he said, bubbling along in the conversation, &quot;is &lt;&lt;if $lovers[6] gte $approval[6]&gt;&gt;how I haven&#39;t seen more of &lt;&lt;if $dup gt 1&gt;&gt;the two of &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;you up until now? I just //love// good conversation. I suppose that&#39;s why I&#39;m specializing in xenolinguistics, so I can talk to everybody in the Federation.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;you&#39;re going to get back home? I mean, obviously you&#39;ll have to book a passage on a different ship, am I right? Of course I am. Perhaps we&#39;ll get lucky and the //Beta Centauri// will be found before the end of the year. Then it&#39;ll all work out, won&#39;t it?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; 

Tras Dinawa was very friendly and easy to get along with, always a good trait to find in a classmate. &lt;&lt;if $lovers[6] gte $approval[6]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I wasn&#39;t&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we weren&#39;t&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; sure if &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; should [[flirt|A: Cadet Flirt]] with him or [[not.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;We would probably be [[friends.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Ordro&quot;&gt;&gt;Cadet Nox looked somewhat suspicious as he listened to &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;my brief introduction: a false name,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;my/our brief introductions: false names,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; a made-up history, and a warm welcome to the Academy. That&#39;s when &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; found out how hard it is to lie to a Betazoid, because Ordro interrupted with a little cough.

&quot;I don&#39;t know why,&quot; he said with strained politeness, &quot;but I can tell you&#39;re not quite telling the truth. Something is ...  wrong. I&#39;m not sure that you are who you say you are. My telepathy is pretty strong, and I may be getting a lot of interference from the crowd, but I&#39;m fairly sure you&#39;re lying to me.&quot; He paused. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not used to having people try to deceive me.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; took stock. Lying to a Betazoid was obviously the wrong approach. &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; I said. &quot;Something happened to me on the way to the Academy. The whole thing is being investigated, and it&#39;s being kept under wraps for now. Even if I could tell you, you probably wouldn&#39;t believe me.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We&#39;re sorry,&quot; I/we said. &quot;Something happened to us on the way to the Academy. The whole thing is being investigated, and it&#39;s being kept under wraps for now. Even if we could tell you, you probably wouldn&#39;t believe us.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

Nox&#39;s eyes widened slightly. &quot;Is it classified?&quot; he asked, obviously impressed. As a fresh-faced cadet, this would be his first encounter with Starfleet&#39;s secrecy protocols.

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said, &quot;but I&#39;ve been asked to keep it fairly quiet.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, and nodded. &quot;That, I can see, is the truth. There are few secrets on Betazed, but I understand Starfleet has different rules, so I will abide by your desire for ...  privacy.&quot; Cadet Nox looked at &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; curiously, and added, &lt;&lt;if $lovers[7] gte $approval[7]&gt;&gt;&quot;I hope you understand when I admit that I am //very// curious.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Of course, telepathy isn&#39;t entirely voluntary.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

He presented himself well, for a cadet, although he had this definite streak of uncertainty about him. &lt;&lt;if $lovers[7] gte $approval[7]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I wasn&#39;t&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we weren&#39;t&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; sure if &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; should [[flirt|A: Cadet Flirt]] with him or [[not.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;We would probably be [[friends.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Darzol&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;&quot;I just wanted to introduce myself,&quot; I said. I wasn&#39;t sure about giving a fake name to a Cadet 2nd Lieutenant, so I just used my family name.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We just wanted to introduce ourselves,&quot; I/we said. I/we weren&#39;t sure about giving fake names to a Cadet 2nd Lieutenant, so I/we just used my family names.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; He frowned momentarily and consulted a PADD on his belt, and his eyes flicked over something that showed up on the tiny screen. Had he been briefed about &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; too?&lt;&lt;set $idx to 8&gt;&gt;

It seemed he had. &quot;Ah, Cadet $playername,&quot; he said. &quot;I read about you in the Starfleet briefing. You were on board the //Beta Centauri?//&quot; When &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; nodded, he went on. &quot;You know, I didn&#39;t quite believe it when I read what had happened, but after speaking to you, I do. I know it sounds odd, but it&#39;s easier to understand when I hear it directly from someone who was there. &lt;&lt;if $lovers[8] gte $approval[8]&gt;&gt;I only hope I would have done as well as you. &lt;&lt;if $rep.includes(&quot;strategist&quot;)&gt;&gt;You kept your head the whole time.&lt;&lt;elseif $rep.includes(&quot;protector&quot;)&gt;&gt;You put other people before yourself the whole time.&lt;&lt;elseif $rep.includes(&quot;thinker&quot;)&gt;&gt;You did well to keep your wits about you the whole time.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Most people might not have.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I -- I want to say I would have too.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It&#39;s a wonder that you were able to get away from that place at all, if you ask me.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; He appraised &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; silently. &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Trill&quot; or $race == &quot;Trill host&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m actually a little jealous. I know you didn&#39;t ask to be turned into one of my people, but not many of us have a symbiont. I was hoping to earn one, but here you are, a sophomore, and already ... well, it&#39;s different for you, I suppose. I can&#39;t look at it the same way.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m a little envious, actually. You get to live something only few people of your kind ever do.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You got to experience something out there in the real world, something far beyond any training exercise or field operation, something the average cadet will never see. And you did well. It&#39;s very impressive.&quot;

&lt;&lt;if $lovers[8] gte $approval[8]&gt;&gt;He seemed sincerely interested in &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;me, and I debated whether I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;me/us, and I/we debated whether I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; should [[flirt|A: Cadet Flirt]] with him or [[not.|A: Cadet Not Flirt]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;He seemed intrigued by everything that had happened on Procrustes.

&lt;&lt;if $course == &quot;Alandra&quot;&gt;&gt;Alandra Dod was so warm and open, it was as if we had been friends for years.

So much to know!

&quot;Oh, of course,&quot; I said, trying to keep up with her stream of friendly confidences.

&quot;And forgive me for saying so,&quot; she said, abruptly changing the subject again, &quot;but you &lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Bolian&quot;&gt;&gt;make one fine-looking man, if I do say so myself.

It was so--&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Anyway, it was worse than you could imagine. I watched so many of my friends get killed. Tortured to death, stabbed. Shot.&quot; She took a deep breath and opened her eyes. &quot;It&#39;s hard to talk about it. I really appreciate your coming over to talk to me. It&#39;s so ... normal. And normal is so //different// here. So much quieter. I keep expecting something to happen, I guess.&quot;

The warrior who cares for his body is always one to have by your side.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;And a sophomore!&quot; she said thoughtfully, nodding to herself in grudging respect. &quot;One day we will both graduate, and then we will be warriors together.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $race == &quot;Cardassian&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Whose ass did you have to kiss to get into Starfleet, Cardassian?&quot; she asked pointedly. &quot;I had to go through the Minister of State and //he// had to go through the Cardassian legate. To see if I was a //criminal.// Which I probably am, let&#39;s be honest,&quot; she added. &quot;Look, I know you&#39;re in Starfleet.

There&#39;s a right way to do things and the sooner everybody sees that, the happier they&#39;re going to be. Science is science. You have to get it right.&quot;

Playing the part of someone who had never met her, &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; asked, &quot;You&#39;re going into science?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, sticking out her chin defiantly, as if daring anyone to doubt her resolve. &quot;I want to get into transporter systems. That&#39;s where you have to be //really// precise, or somebody&#39;s atoms get scattered all across subspace. I&#39;d like to see my incompetent lab partner last year do //that.//&quot;

There was just no slipping anything past her.

&quot;No, I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; she said sadly, shaking her head. &quot;No, please stop. What you&#39;re telling me is not the truth. I don&#39;t know exactly what you&#39;re thinking, or why you&#39;re trying to deceive me about who you are, but you&#39;re embarrassing yourself. Please, just go.&quot;

Well, that was that. &lt;&lt;if $dup == 1&gt;&gt;I suppose I should go&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I/we suppose it&#39;s time to&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; [[talk to someone else.|A: Commons]]

A one-time analysis has to fire so we can sort out which things happen on which days, and which elements are part of the cycle.

* Your reputation comes into play. If you are known for a certain kind of action on Procrustes, that comes back. Also, if you tell too many people, your secret will get out.

* Some detail page pops up on your classes, to make each distinct. If the player is duplicated, we devise a way to handle it.

* Your division (comm, sec, ops, eng, sci, med) determines how your skills are utilized in sorting out the Procrustes thing.

* Your race (or duplication) governs a second set of story elements: how you adjust to the role, how others accept you, what missions you can be sent on, what research is done on you.

* Your old BF/GF factors in, whether you are seeing him/her or not. There is, at last, a breaking point: are you stuck like this, are you through, are you moving on?

* Your new BF/GF factors in also. Are you stuck like this? Is this temporary? Are we really a thing?

* Your rank factors in. You have responsibilities. If you achieved a good rank, that enables you to go on the mission back to Procrustes.


GAME CYCLE STRUCTURE

* Set up standard background/framing.

* 




* When all mandatory elements have been completed, unlock the link to (proceed) to the next week. Build the date-incrementation into the link so it can&#39;t fire multiple times.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
